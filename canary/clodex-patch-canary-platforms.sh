# clodex-patch-canary-platforms.sh — the per-platform half of the canary.
#
# Sourced by clodex-patch-canary.sh (and, through it, by the self-test). It defines the platform
# matrix and the three ways a platform can be tested; the main script owns state, locking, Slack
# and the investigation.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# `clodex patch` does two separable things, and they fail for different reasons:
#
#   the patch sites  match anchors in the extracted JavaScript. This was assumed to be
#                    near-identical on every platform (26,599,210 bytes on darwin vs 26,596,328 on
#                    linux for 2.1.233), so that one platform covered them all. 2.1.238 disproved
#                    it: `PATCH 5: model picker options` matched on darwin-arm64, darwin-x64,
#                    linux-x64, linux-x64-musl and win32-x64 and NOT on linux-arm64,
#                    linux-arm64-musl or win32-arm64. Every build's anchors are now checked
#                    against that build's own bundle.
#   the container    tweakcc's read, the repack, and Mach-O signing depend on the
#                    executable format — and that is the half
#                    that broke. Every ELF build of Claude Code from 2.1.229 on was unpatchable
#                    across two clodex releases while macOS stayed green, because the canary only
#                    ever tested the host. An outside contributor reported it, not us.
#
# So every downloaded platform build now runs the cross-platform probe, plus the strongest
# execution check available for it:
#
#   probe      scripts/probe-patch-mechanism.mjs from the clodex checkout under test: it applies
#              every clodex patch site to the bundle it extracts from THAT build, checks the exact
#              compaction-prompt markers, repacks what those transforms produced, and runs the same
#              read/repack/publish/sign cycle the patcher runs. It never executes the binary, so it
#              works from macOS against every format.
#   host       the real `clodex patch` on this Mac, after the probe — the authoritative "is it safe
#              for me to update" answer, and the only leg that patches AND then starts the binary
#              here.
#   container  the real `clodex patch` inside a native-architecture Linux container, after the
#              probe. `clodex patch` resolves the version by EXECUTING the binary, so a foreign
#              binary cannot go through the real command on the host — a container is the only way
#              to run the whole thing against ELF.
#
# On probe-only platforms, what remains unproved is that the patched binary starts. On every
# platform, matching an anchor cannot prove it bound to the intended function rather than a
# lookalike that also parses.
#
# A leg that cannot RUN (no Docker, a platform package that has not published yet, a container
# that could not install its dependencies) is an `error`, never a `fail`. Only evidence that the
# patch mechanism is broken may say Claude Code is unsafe — otherwise a Docker Desktop that
# happens to be quit would page you about a release that is perfectly fine.

# name | member inside the tarball | container image for a full-patch leg (empty: probe only)
#
# linux-x64 under emulation was deliberately left out: x64 and arm64 ELF behave identically here
# (both failed and both were fixed by the same change) and qemu is not worth the hourly cost. The
# probe still covers linux-x64's bytes; only the "does the patched binary run" half is arm64-only.
