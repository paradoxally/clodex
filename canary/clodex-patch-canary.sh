#
# clodex-patch-canary.sh — early warning for "the next Claude Code release breaks clodex patch".
#
# Each run:
#   1. asks the npm registry for the newest Claude Code release on a dist-tag (default: latest)
#   2. stops immediately if that version was already triaged, or if a previous failure is still
#      being investigated by a background Claude session
#   3. syncs a private clone of clodex to a freshly fetched origin/main and builds it
#   4. downloads that release for EVERY published platform into a throwaway sandbox and tests each
#      one — the real `clodex patch` on this Mac, the real `clodex patch` in a Linux container for
#      arm64 glibc and musl, and a bundle-patch + binary-handling probe for the rest. See
#      clodex-patch-canary-platforms.sh for why, and for what each leg proves.
#   5. if any platform's patch mechanism is broken, launches ONE background Claude session to
#      investigate all of them, fix, and open a PR — and pings Slack at the start
#
# It never installs Claude Code, never patches the installed Claude Code, and never writes to
# ~/.clodex or ~/.tweakcc: the patch run is redirected with CLODEX_HOME, TWEAKCC_CONFIG_DIR and
# TWEAKCC_CC_INSTALLATION_PATH, and runs with HOME pointed inside the sandbox.
#
# Usage: clodex-patch-canary.sh [options]
#   --status            print triage state and exit
#   --version VER       test this Claude Code version instead of the dist-tag's
#   --retriage VER      forget VER's recorded verdict, then run
#   --force             ignore the already-triaged record and the in-flight deferral
#   --platforms LIST    comma-separated platforms to test instead of all of them
#   --no-container      never use Docker; test Linux with the probe only (no binary is started)
#   --no-launch         report a failure but do not start the background Claude session
#   --no-slack          never post to Slack
#   --keep-work         keep the sandbox even when the run passes

# for the other seven.
#
# The merge is `+`, NOT `*`. `*` merges recursively, so a platform's new entry would inherit `sites`
# keys from the entry it replaced. That silently defeats the leg-mode guard in the comparison above:
# a host/container leg records `probe:PATCH …` names that a probe-only leg never emits, so after one
# Docker outage the fresh probe entry carried the container run's leftover names, the guard saw two
# matching `probe` modes and compared anyway, and the next run announced all eleven leftover names
# as checks that were "not attempted at all this time". A leg's record must be exactly what that leg

  cat <<EOF
You are triaging an automated canary failure. Be rigorous: this may end in a pull request that
changes binary patching or updates clodex's exact knowledge of Claude Code.

WHAT HAPPENED
Claude Code $version was published. An automated canary attempted every published platform package.
It probed each build it downloaded and ran the real \`clodex patch\` wherever that binary could be
executed. It used freshly fetched origin/main ($MAIN_SHA — $MAIN_SUBJECT) and did not come out clean:

$reasons

THE PLATFORM MATRIX
$(jq -s -r 'map("  \(.platform)\t[\(.mode)]\t\(.status)")[]' "$MATRIX")

Every matrix row whose mode is not \`none\` first ran scripts/probe-patch-mechanism.mjs. It checks
exact compaction-prompt markers, applies every clodex patch site to that build's extracted bundle,
and runs the read/repack/publish/sign cycle without executing the result. A \`none\` row downloaded
nothing and ran no check. The other matrix modes name the strongest additional tier available:
  host       the real \`clodex patch\` on this Mac, all patch sites end to end.
  container  the real \`clodex patch\` inside a native-arch Linux container. \`clodex patch\`
             resolves the version by EXECUTING the binary, so a foreign binary can only go through
             the real command this way.
  probe      no execution tier was available; the universal probe is the whole result.
A failure confined to one executable format (ELF, Mach-O, PE) points at src/bun-module-table.ts,
src/patch-signature.ts, or tweakcc's repack, not at the patch anchors. A patch-site failure on every
checked platform points at the anchors in src/patch-transforms.ts.

A \`compact-prompt-markers\` failure is NOT a patch failure: no patch site is broken. On a complete
bundle extraction it means Claude Code reworded its compaction prompt, so clodex's text-only guard
stops firing, auto-compaction fails on OpenAI models, and long sessions die with "Prompt is too
long". First confirm the extracted source still contains both compaction builders; a bundle-reader
omission has the same symptom. Then read the new wording and update only the corresponding marker(s)
in src/claude-code-compact-prompt.ts before rerunning the probe.

If instead the reasons say a check that passed on an earlier release now SKIPs, the release is
patchable and an ANCHOR DRIFTED: diff the two bundles with scripts/extract-cc-bundles.mjs (last
clean release: $BASE_VERSION) before changing it.

Two limits on what a green leg proves, so you do not report a fix as verified when it is not:
- A leg recorded as \`probe\` never STARTS the binary it patched. It proves the anchors matched and
  the repack round-tripped; it cannot prove the patched binary runs, and it cannot tell an anchor
  that bound to the wrong function from one that bound to the right one. Where that distinction
  decides your fix, re-run the leg as
  \`MODE=container $WORK/repro.sh <platform> <your-worktree>\`, and if Docker is unavailable, say so
  in your concluding Slack rather than calling it verified.
- No leg ever EXECUTES an x64 ELF binary; x64 coverage is bytes-only by design. Check x64
  reasoning against the linux-arm64 container leg.

EVIDENCE (read these first)
- Full canary log, including every leg's report and both output streams:
  $logfile
- The full matrix as JSON, one object per platform (reasons, sizes, markers, per-site results):
  $MATRIX
- The sandbox was deliberately preserved so you can reproduce without touching anything real:
  $WORK
    $WORK/<platform>/      one directory per platform. A FAILING leg's binary is kept; a passing
                           one's was deleted to save ~300 MB each. Container legs also leave
                           out/patch.stdout, out/patch.stderr and out/docker.log.
    $WORK/clodex-home      the CLODEX_HOME every leg used
    $WORK/tweakcc          the pristine backup the host leg made
- The clodex build under test: $REPO_DIR (detached at origin/main)

REPRODUCE — USE THE TIER THAT REPORTED THE FAILURE
  MODE=probe $WORK/repro.sh <platform>          # universal bundle/marker probe
  $WORK/repro.sh <platform>                    # strongest recorded execution tier
  $WORK/repro.sh <platform> <your-worktree>    # that execution tier against your fix
The default command picks the matrix mode; on host/container platforms it does not repeat the probe
that ran before that tier. Each command seeds a fresh sandbox and redirects HOME, CLODEX_HOME,
TWEAKCC_CONFIG_DIR and TWEAKCC_CC_INSTALLATION_PATH. With no arguments it runs this Mac's execution
tier against origin/main. Your worktree does not need to be built first. Read the script before you
run it; if you need a variant, copy it and edit the copy.

Fix the ROOT CAUSE once. Several platforms failing together is almost always one defect — the
last time this happened, all four ELF builds broke on a single line in the restore sweep. Do not
open four PRs, and do not fix one platform in a way that only works for that platform. Verify a
probe or prompt-marker fix with \`MODE=probe\` for every downloaded row in the matrix (mode other
than \`none\`), failing and passing alike. Also rerun each platform's default tier when binary
handling or real patch execution changed;
a format that was fine can still regress.

HARD CONSTRAINTS
- **Never run a bare \`clodex patch\` or \`node dist/cli.js patch\`.** With no
  TWEAKCC_CC_INSTALLATION_PATH set, clodex resolves the target to ~/.local/bin/claude and would
  patch the human's REAL, IN-USE Claude Code install, writing real backups into ~/.tweakcc and real
  state into ~/.clodex. Your environment does NOT have those redirections set — only repro.sh does.
  Every patch invocation goes through $WORK/repro.sh or a copy of it.
- NEVER write to ~/.local/bin/claude, ~/.local/share/claude, ~/.clodex or ~/.tweakcc by any other
  means either — no --restore, no cp, no chmod.
- Do NOT work in the $CLODEX_WORKING_COPY working copy — it belongs to a human and may hold
  unrelated in-progress work. Create a git worktree off a freshly fetched origin/main
  (\`git -C $CLODEX_WORKING_COPY fetch origin\` then
  \`git -C $CLODEX_WORKING_COPY worktree add ../clodex-canary-$version -b fix/patch-cc-$version origin/main\`)
  and do all work there.

WHAT TO DO
1. Post a Slack message the moment you have a first read on the cause (see NOTIFY below).
2. Diagnose the root cause in the Claude Code $version bundle, not the symptom. Read
   .claude/docs/patcher.md and .claude/docs/claude-code-internals.md first; the transforms in
   src/patch-transforms.ts are hard-won and change only with byte-for-byte evidence on a real
   binary. scripts/extract-cc-bundles.mjs extracts a bundle for inspection.
3. Fix it, following CLAUDE.md and .claude/skills/pr-verification/SKILL.md in full — including
   bumping PATCH_TRANSFORMS_VERSION if the transform set changed materially, and a test that fails
   before the fix and passes after.
4. Verify: \`pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build\`, then re-run every downloaded row in the
   matrix — \`for p in $(jq -s -r 'map(select(.mode != "none") | .platform) | join(" ")' "$MATRIX");
   do $WORK/repro.sh \$p <your-worktree>; done\` — and confirm each one comes out clean on a pristine
   $version copy.
5. Run an adversarial review panel over your own change before pushing, per the pr-verification
   skill. Fix what it finds; re-review after changes.
6. Open a PR against main with \`gh pr create\`. Write the summary line for a user who has never read
   the source, per the commit-message rules in CLAUDE.md.

NOTIFY (both of these are required)
Post to Slack with:
  $SLACK_PYTHON $SLACK_PY notify $CANARY_SLACK_TO "<message>"
- At the start: one line on what you think broke and that you are on it.
- At the end, whichever applies: the PR URL, or the obstacle that stopped you and what you need. If
  you cannot fix it, still report the diagnosis — a precise "here is why it broke and why the fix is
  not obvious" is a good outcome.
Do not finish without sending the concluding message.

# worth asking of a leg that otherwise looks clean: an aborted patch leaves every later site
# unreported, which would bury the real cause under a list of sites that never got to run.
# Two different things can make a site stop applying, and they deserve different reactions:
#   attempted but SKIP/FAIL  -> the anchor is still there but the binary changed under it. That is
#                               exactly the silent breakage this canary exists to catch. Investigate.
#   never attempted at all   -> clodex chose not to run that site, because the config or the model
#                               registry no longer asks for it (no context windows, no effort
#                               defaults) or because main retired the site. Not Claude Code's doing:
#                               say so once, re-baseline, and let the release pass.
# Without that split, one favourites edit would fail every future release forever, because the
