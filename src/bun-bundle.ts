// src/bun-bundle.ts — the Claude Code bundle as ONE string, however many Bun modules hold it.
//
// Through Claude Code 2.1.241 the bundle was a single Bun module: tweakcc read it, clodex patched
// the string, tweakcc wrote it back. 2.1.242 code-split it — the entry module became a ~20 KB ESM
// stub that imports ~1,370 `chunk-*.js` siblings — so `readContent` started returning a stub with
// none of clodex's anchors in it and `PATCH 1` failed on every platform and every executable
// format at once.
//
// This module restores the old contract without changing a single patch transform: every
// JavaScript module is read, joined into one document for `applyClodexPatches`, and split back
// afterwards. `applyClodexPatches` stays a pure string -> string function that neither knows nor
// cares how many modules the bundle arrived in.
//
// WRITING IT BACK IS THE HARD HALF, and the reason has changed twice.
//
// tweakcc's `writeContent` replaces the payload of every module whose NAME it recognizes, with one
// buffer — it has no way to say "this module gets these bytes and that one gets those". Calling it
// once per changed module is not an option either: every repack of an ELF build relocates the whole
// ~290 MB blob to the end of the binary, so six repacks would leave a multi-gigabyte claude and take
// minutes. That is why there is one repack here however many modules the patch touched.
//
// The deeper problem is that tweakcc REBUILDS the blob, from the per-module `{ offset, length }`
// pairs and the exec-argv string — carrying `entryPointId`, `flags` and each module's
// loader/encoding/format/side across as scalars, but reconstructing the payload region from those
// ranges alone. So a region no range describes is silently dropped, and every offset that survives
// moves. Through Bun 1.4.0 (Claude Code 2.1.245) that was close enough to
// lossless to work. Bun 1.4.1 (Claude Code 2.1.246) is not: after the module table it writes a
// `[u32; modules]` of source hashes, an ahead-of-time bytecode table, and a ~9.9 MB shared bytecode
// string table that every chunk's compiled form references by ordinal — announced by the blob's
// `flags` word and reachable from no module range. (The string table itself is written among the
// payloads, BEFORE the module table; it is the 8-byte pointer to it that follows the table.) A
// rebuild kept the flags, dropped all of it, and the patched binary segfaulted inside Bun before
// printing its version. It also packs every
// module's cached bytecode wherever it lands, and JSC requires that 128-byte aligned because it
// decodes it in place.
//
// So the blob is not rebuilt. The pristine bytes are published verbatim, each patched module's
// source is APPENDED past the end of them, and the module table is repointed in place — everything
// clodex does not understand survives because nothing moved it. tweakcc's repack is still what
// resizes the container's Bun section (the only part that needs node-lief, and the part that knows
// Mach-O from ELF from PE), but the buffer handed to it is a placeholder, and every byte of the
// blob it produces is overwritten afterwards. The section's own 8-byte length header is the one
// exception: it is left exactly as the repack wrote it, and the published blob is padded to match
// the length it declares.
