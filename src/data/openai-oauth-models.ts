// (sk-...) and are rejected by api.openai.com/v1/models. The Codex backend exposes
// its own account-scoped catalog, which discovery reads when reachable; these seeds
// are the fallback and stay authoritative whenever that probe fails or returns
// nothing. Availability still varies by tier, so the full set is listed and the user
// discovers what their plan unlocks at inference time.

 * reserve plus a 13,000 summary buffer) and applies no share of its own to the
 * number it is given, so the reduction was pure loss of usable context.
 *
 * Discarded at projection rather than at refresh so an install that never re-runs
 * `clodex providers refresh-models` still gets its window back. The cache file itself
 * is never rewritten by this, so the check has to stay for as long as those caches do.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION: this keys on the value, and 95 is exactly the share the Codex
 * client uses, so it is the most plausible number the catalog would ever start
 * reporting. If it does, clodex will ignore it. That is a deliberate trade rather than
 * an oversight — 95 is a CLIENT-side convention, and clodex is not the client; Claude
 * Code is, and it does its own reserving. Revisit if the catalog ever populates this
 * field, which it does not today (null for all ten models it returns, 2026-09-05).
