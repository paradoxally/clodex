// Keeps tweakcc's ELF repack able to find the address it expects to rewrite when it moves Bun's
// embedded blob.
//
// Read `.claude/docs/patcher.md` first. tweakcc's ELF repack searches for a pointer at a
// 16 KiB-aligned location, but newer Claude Code builds moved the real pointer off that boundary.
// A reversible byte-level stand-in lets tweakcc repack the blob without forking its ELF writer.
//
// THE RULE. A Bun standalone ELF stores the virtual address of its `.bun` section in an 8-byte
// little-endian global. `repackELFSection` moves `.bun` to a fresh page past the end of the file
// and rewrites that global to match. (It is tweakcc that insists on finding it — startup itself
// still locates the blob from the end-of-file trailer, which is why a stale value is wrong
// rather than fatal. See WHAT A WRONG ANSWER COSTS below.) It finds it by
// scanning the first writable `PT_LOAD` segment for 8 bytes equal to `.bun`'s CURRENT virtual
// address — but only at addresses that are multiples of 16384. tweakcc 4.3.0 and 4.3.3 both do
// this; bumping the pin does not help.
//
// WHAT BROKE. Through Claude Code 2.1.252 that global happened to land on a 16 KiB boundary on
// every ELF build (measured: 2.1.246 and 2.1.252, x64 and arm64, glibc and musl — all at
// `vaddr % 16384 === 0`). Claude Code 2.1.257 moved it off one: 0x534f758 on linux-x64,
// 0x4d9af08 on linux-x64-musl, 0x5310758 on linux-arm64, 0x4c46d10 on linux-arm64-musl. The
// strided scan steps straight over it, `repackELFSection` throws "Could not find original
// BUN_COMPILED location in binary", and `clodex patch` fails on all four ELF builds. Nothing about
// clodex's own patches changed; the alignment the scan assumes is not a property Bun promises.
//
// THE STAND-IN. Before the repack, plant a copy of the value the scan is looking for at an address
// the scan DOES visit, and remember the eight bytes displaced. tweakcc then finds that copy and
// rewrites it to the new `.bun` address. Afterwards, copy the new address to where the real global
// actually lives and put the displaced bytes back, so the published binary differs from a
// pristine repack in exactly one place: the global, holding the value it was always meant to hold.
//
// Two things make that safe rather than clever, and both are checked rather than assumed:
//   * the real global is identified, not guessed: the ONE 8-byte occurrence of `.bun`'s address
//     inside the writable segment and outside `.bun`'s own payload. Matches inside the payload are
//     coincidences in compressed JavaScript — up to five on the arm64 builds measured — and are
//     excluded by range. Anything other than exactly one candidate is refused, loudly, instead of
//     patched.
//   * it is a NO-OP wherever tweakcc already lands on that same address. So an older release, and
//     any future release that goes back to being aligned, takes the path it always took. Note the
//     order: the census above runs FIRST and the no-op defers to it, so tweakcc settling on some
//     OTHER aligned copy is refused rather than waved through.
// The restore reads back both addresses and refuses a binary where either did not take.
//
// WHAT A WRONG ANSWER COSTS. Not a binary that fails to start — that was this file's original
// claim and it is wrong. Measured on published 2.1.257 linux-x64 and linux-x64-musl: revert only
// the global to its pre-repack value and `claude --version` still works, so Bun locates the blob
// another way (the end-of-file trailer `bun-bundle.ts` describes). What a wrong answer costs is
// eight bytes of live data rewritten and never restored. The addresses in play are not spare: the
// stand-in slot lands in `.data` on the glibc builds and in `.tdata`, the TLS initialisation
// image, on the musl ones. That is why this refuses instead of guessing.
