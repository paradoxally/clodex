// tool-schema-sanitize.ts — drop `pattern` constraints a non-Anthropic provider cannot compile.
//
// Leaf module by design: it imports nothing from src/, like its sibling
// tool-input-sanitize.ts, so the translation path can use it from anywhere in
// the import graph.
//
// Claude Code writes its built-in tool schemas in the ECMAScript regex dialect
// (an MCP or plugin tool's schema comes from its author, in whatever dialect
// they wrote). OpenAI rejects every regex-valued position that python-jsonschema
// would: the 400 reads `Invalid schema for function 'X': '<pattern>' is not a
// 'regex'`, that library's format-checker wording, and locally its checker is a
// bare `re.compile`. That is behavioural evidence about the far side, not
// source-level knowledge of what it runs. Claude Code 2.1.266's Artifact tool
// spells its `field` constraint with Unicode property escapes
// (`[^\p{Cc}\p{Cf}\p{Zl}\p{Zp}...]`), Python answers `bad escape \p`, and every
// request carrying that tool 400s before the model sees the turn — Artifact
// ships on every request, so the session was dead from `hello` onward (#194).
//
// Two regex-valued positions exist, and the far side compiles both: the
// `pattern` keyword, and every **key** of `patternProperties`
// (`patternProperties.propertyNames` carries `format: "regex"` in the 2020-12
// applicator vocabulary, and a bad key returns the same `is not a 'regex'`
// message). Only those two positions are edited, and only the constraint goes —
// never the property it constrains, and never a wildcard in its place. The
// schema the provider sees does become more permissive than the one Claude Code
// wrote: that is unavoidable, since the alternative is a 400. What it must not
// do is become *less* permissive.
//
// **Sanitizing only ever loosens.** That is the invariant the rest of this
// module protects, and `patternProperties` is the one place where removing a
// constraint would otherwise tighten: with a sibling `additionalProperties` or
// `unevaluatedProperties`, the dropped entry was the only thing *admitting* its
// keys, so removing it alone turns them from permitted into forbidden and the
// tool stops accepting input it used to. When an entry is dropped, the sibling
// closure keyword is therefore dropped too (`true` is already the permissive
// default and is left alone).
//
// The walk follows only **declared schema positions** (`properties` values,
// `items`, `anyOf`, `$defs`, …). Keywords that hold instance *data* rather than
// rules — `const`, `enum`, `default`, `examples` — are opaque. Inside `const`
// or `enum` a `pattern` member is a value the schema requires, so deleting it
// changes which instances validate; `default` and `examples` are annotations,
// where the reason is simply that instance data is not a schema and must not be
// rewritten as one.
//
// Simple lookahead and fixed-width lookbehind compile in both dialects, so
// Artifact's `collection` pattern (`^(?!\.\.?(?:\/|$))...`) is left alone.
// Two caveats, both deliberate:
//   - **Variable-width lookbehind** — alternated (`(?<=a|bb)`) or quantified
//     (`(?<=a+)`, `(?<=\d{2,3})`) — is legal in ECMAScript (ES2018) and
//     rejected by Python's `re` ("look-behind requires fixed-width pattern").
//     Recognising it needs a real regex parser, so this module does not, and
//     such a pattern would still 400. Only 14 distinct `pattern` values reach a
//     built-in tool schema in 2.1.266, and none of them uses one — Artifact's
//     `field` is the only Python-incompatible value among them.
//   - The scanner is narrower than Python in other ways too — `[\w-.]` (a
//     shorthand escape as a range endpoint) and the JS `[^]` idiom compile in
//     ECMAScript and are rejected by Python. None of those 14 values hits one
//     either; they are reachable only from a hand-written MCP or plugin schema,
//     are not new here, and widening the scanner is tracked separately.
//   - **Lookaround is reported rejected on OpenAI's strict structured-output
//     path** (vercel/ai#16021, SmartBear/smartbear-mcp#491 — reports, not
//     something verified here; the vercel maintainers could not reproduce it
//     from a synthetic case). clodex does not meet that path: `translateTools`
//     sends `strict: false` on `@ai-sdk/openai`, which covers both OpenAI
//     routes and OpenCode Go's Responses model, and
//     `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` goes to Chat Completions, which is
//     non-strict by default. The explicit opt-out is load-bearing for
//     keeping Artifact's `collection` lookahead in the payload; if it is ever
//     removed, lookaround has to be stripped here too.
//
// What dropping a constraint costs depends on the tool, and the comfortable
// version of this claim is wrong. Claude Code does `inputSchema.safeParse` before
// executing, but only a built-in whose Zod schema carries the same constraint is
// still guarded — Artifact's `field` is (`field: s().regex(...)` in the 2.1.266
// bundle). A registered tool gets `c({}).passthrough()` as its `inputSchema` with
// the real schema parked in `inputJSONSchema`, and the MCP path checks only that
// `required` keys are present. So for an MCP or plugin tool the dropped regex is
// a genuinely lost guard, not just a lost hint: nothing revalidates it, and a
// bad value reaches the tool's own handler. That is still the better trade — the
// constraint was going to 400 the whole session otherwise — but it is a real
// cost, and it is why nothing here drops more than it must.
