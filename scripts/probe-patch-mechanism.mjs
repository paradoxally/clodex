// Would `clodex patch` work on a Claude Code build for ANOTHER platform?
//
// Two separable halves, and this answers both without ever EXECUTING the binary — which is what
// lets a linux-arm64 or win32-x64 build be checked from macOS. (Running it is what `clodex patch`
// itself needs, since it resolves the version by executing the binary; that is why full-patch
// coverage for Linux needs a container and this does not.)
//
//   the container   tweakcc's read, the repack, and Mach-O signing all depend on the
//                   executable format. Every ELF build of Claude Code
//                   from 2.1.229 onward was unpatchable across two clodex releases while macOS
//                   stayed green, because nothing tested an ELF binary.
//   the patch sites the anchors clodex matches in the extracted JavaScript. These were long
//                   assumed to be platform-independent — "one platform covers them all". 2.1.238
//                   proved otherwise: `PATCH 5: model picker options` matched on five builds and
//                   not on linux-arm64, linux-arm64-musl or win32-arm64. So this probe applies the
//                   real transforms to the real bundle it extracted from THIS build, and publishes
//                   what they produced rather than the pristine bytes.
//
// Read the second half precisely, because it changed. tweakcc's repack is no longer given the
// patched bundle at all — it is given a placeholder, purely to resize the container's Bun section,
// and clodex publishes the patched blob over that section itself. So the readback below proves the
// RESIZE works on this format and that clodex's own publish round-trips byte for byte; it no longer
// proves anything about the patched bytes surviving tweakcc's rebuild, because they never enter it.
//
// What it still does NOT establish, and must never be reported as if it did: the patched binary is
// never started, so nothing here says a PE runs on Windows or an ELF runs on Linux. And an anchor
// that binds to the WRONG function while still emitting valid JavaScript passes every check below.
// Only the host and container legs of the canary run the patched binary.
