// The patch-site half of scripts/probe-patch-mechanism.mjs.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// The probe used to check the CONTAINER only — shim, read, repack, restore — on the theory that
// the extracted JavaScript is near-identical on every platform, so one platform's `clodex patch`
// covers the anchors for all of them. Claude Code 2.1.238 disproved that: `PATCH 5: model picker
// options` matched on darwin-arm64, darwin-x64, linux-x64, linux-x64-musl and win32-x64, and did
// NOT match on linux-arm64, linux-arm64-musl or win32-arm64. The two Linux builds have containers
// and reported `fail`; win32-arm64 has no image, so it was a probe — and a probe exercised zero
// patch sites, so it reported a clean `pass` on a build clodex could not correctly patch.
//
// So the probe now applies the REAL transforms to the REAL bundle it just extracted. That needs
// no host of the target platform and no execution: the anchors are matched against a string.
//
// It is kept in its own module so `tests/probe-patch-sites.test.ts` can pin the expectations below
// against the actual transform set. Without that pin, adding or renaming a PATCH site would make
// every probe leg fail at 03:00 as if Claude Code had broken; with it, `pnpm test` reddens first.

/**
 * One synthetic model that turns on every conditional patch site.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the operator's real favorites: the probe must ask the same question of every
 * release regardless of whose machine it runs on, and half these sites are skipped entirely by a
 * config that omits `alias`, `context`, `display` or `effort`. `effort` lists all five native
 * levels because PATCH 8b and 8c are gated on `xhigh` and `max` being declared.
 *
 * The alias is long and unlovely on purpose — it has to be a name no Claude Code build already
 * contains, or PATCH 1/3/5 would report SKIP ("already patched") against a pristine bundle.
