# Claude Code internals we have verified

<!-- Read before asserting anything about how Claude Code itself behaves, and before re-deriving
     something in this list. -->

Everything here was read out of a real Claude Code bundle. **Each section states the version it was
verified against wherever that was recorded** — Claude Code is minified and reshaped between
releases, so treat an entry older than the version you care about as a lead, not a fact, and
re-verify before relying on it. Where a stamp is missing or open-ended (`2.1.223+` means "first seen
in .223 and not re-checked since"), treat the entry as *less* trustworthy, not more, and stamp it
properly the next time you confirm it.

Nothing in this file is a clodex invariant. It is what the *client* does, which is why our
invariants are shaped the way they are.

## How to read the bundle

Raw byte greps **do not work** — the JS is compressed inside the native binary. Extract it:

```bash
node scripts/extract-cc-bundles.mjs           # → <tmpdir>/cc-bundles, or $REVIEW_BUNDLE_DIR
export REVIEW_BUNDLE_DIR=<that directory>     # the real-bundle harnesses read this
```

That script walks every pristine `*.orig` backup in `~/.tweakcc` (override with
`TWEAKCC_CONFIG_DIR`) and writes one `.js` per version (~23 MB before 2.1.242, ~36 MB after),
skipping any it has already extracted. It uses clodex's own tweakcc dependency for detection, and
`readClaudeBundle` for the JavaScript, which is why it has to run from inside this repo, where
`node_modules` resolves.

**The file it writes is a JOIN of every JavaScript module**, separated by
``/*clodex:module-boundary`;{}"]*/`` lines — the same document `clodex patch` matches its anchors
against. That is true of every version, not only the split ones: a pre-2.1.242 binary carries the
bundle plus five ~2 KB helper modules, so its extract is a six-module join. Since 2.1.242 it is
roughly 1,380. Do not go back to tweakcc's `readContent` for this: it returns only the module it
recognizes by name, which since 2.1.242 is a ~20 KB stub holding none of Claude Code's behaviour.

Extract from a **pristine** `.orig` backup, never a patched live binary: a patched claude reports
its version perfectly well, so the only thing distinguishing them is the patch marker.

Then **enumerate every branch of the function yourself.** Shipped bugs have come from reading the two
gates that happened to be visible, and from grepping one syntactic form of a comparison — grep the
*value*, then trace every hit.

## The bundle was code-split in 2.1.242

Through 2.1.241 the whole ~28 MB bundle was ONE Bun module. 2.1.242 split it: the entry module is
now a ~20 KB ESM stub whose body is `import{…}from"/$bunfs/root/chunk-<hash>.js"` plus a `main()`
call, and the code lives in ~1,374 sibling `chunk-*.js` modules — 1,391 modules in the blob, against
15 before. Chunk names are content-hashed, so they differ between releases AND between platform
builds of the same release.

| Version | Modules in the blob | Entry module payload |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.1.232 | 15 | 26,504,651 bytes — the whole bundle |
| 2.1.241 | 15 | 28,252,504 bytes — the whole bundle |
| 2.1.242, 2.1.243 | 1,391 | ~19,950 bytes — an import stub |
| 2.1.245 | 1,393 | 19,949 bytes — an import stub |
| 2.1.246 | 1,582 | 20,605 bytes — an import stub |

(Measured on darwin-arm64. 2.1.242 and 2.1.243 have the same module count and differ only in their
chunk hashes and version string. 2.1.246 adds 189 modules over 2.1.245: 25 more JavaScript chunks
and 164 embedded text files — 118 `.md` and 46 `.txt`, carrying a loader id, 13, that no earlier
release used, and which Bun does not execute as JavaScript.)

Consequences worth knowing before you touch any of this:

- **The anchors did not move; the reader did.** Every clodex patch site still occurs exactly once
  across the bundle — they are just in six different chunks on 2.1.243, none of them the entry.
- **Bun executed the chunk SOURCE, not the chunk bytecode — through 2.1.245 only.** Verified on
  2.1.243 darwin-arm64 by overwriting eleven bytes of one chunk's payload in place (`Your prompt` →
  `YOUR_PROMPT`), re-signing, and running `claude --help`: the edited string is what printed. **On
  2.1.246 this is no longer true** — see the Bun 1.4.1 section below. The reason it changed is that
  the source hash JSC keys its code cache on used to be computed from the source that is actually
  there; since Bun 1.4.1 it is read out of the blob.
- **A module's payload can be repointed without moving it.** `{ offset, length }` in the module
  struct is the only thing that says where a module's source is, so several modules can be patched
  in ONE repack by appending their new sources past the end of the blob and pointing each module at
  its own slice. That is what `src/bun-bundle.ts` does.

## The blob carries more than the module structs describe (Bun 1.4.1, 2.1.246)

Claude Code 2.1.245 ships Bun 1.4.0; 2.1.246 ships **Bun 1.4.1**, and 1.4.1 writes three structures
after the module table that no module struct points at. Which of them are present is announced by
the blob's `flags` word — 15 on 2.1.245, 255 on 2.1.246 — and every one of them is addressed by an
offset relative to the start of the blob:

| Flag | Bit | What follows the module table |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SOURCE_TEXT_CONTIGUOUS` | 4 | nothing; it asserts every module's source lies in one run |
| `HAS_SOURCE_HASHES` | 5 | `[u32; modules]`, each module's WTF source hash (`0` = not recorded) |
| `HAS_BUILTIN_BYTECODE` | 6 | `u32 count`, then `count` x `{ u32 id, u32 offset, u32 length }` |
| `HAS_BYTECODE_STRING_TABLE` | 7 | one `{ u32 offset, u32 length }` for the shared string table |

On a real 2.1.246 darwin-arm64 that is 6,328 bytes of source hashes, a builtin-bytecode table with a
count of zero, and a pointer to a **9,878,164-byte shared bytecode string table** every chunk's
compiled form references by ordinal — 6,341 bytes of tail plus ~9.9 MB of payload, none of it
reachable from a module struct. Read the layout precisely: only the tail records follow the module
table. The string table PAYLOAD is written among the other payloads, well before it (offset
103,812,984 of 164,222,846 on that build, with the module table at 164,134,241); it is the 8-byte
`{offset, length}` record pointing at it that comes after. Two more invariants come with it, from Bun's own source
(`src/standalone_graph/StandaloneModuleGraph.rs`, `append_bytecode_aligned`):

- **Cached bytecode must start 128-byte aligned once mapped**, because JSC decodes it in place. The
  blob's section base is aligned to at least 512 bytes in every container Bun emits and its data
  begins 8 bytes in, so every bytecode offset is `120 mod 128` blob-relative and `0 mod 128` once
  mapped — checked and true on 2.1.245 and on all six 2.1.246 builds.
- **A source hash vouches for the bytecode beside it, and on 2.1.246 the bytecode WINS.** The hash
  exists so a module loaded from bytecode never has to page in its source text to hash it — so a
  module whose source is replaced while its recorded hash and bytecode are left alone runs its
  PRE-PATCH compiled form. Measured, on a pristine 2.1.246 darwin-arm64: rewriting all 1,659
  occurrences of `2.1.246` in the JavaScript source to the same-length `2.1.XXX`, leaving every
  bytecode range and source hash alone, re-signing, then `claude --version` → prints **`2.1.246`**.
  The identical edit with each touched module's bytecode, module info and source hash cleared →
  prints **`2.1.XXX`**. That matched pair is why `clodex patch` clears them.
  The bound on the risk is that JSC's cache key also carries the source LENGTH, so an edit that
  changes a module's length is rejected regardless. Every built-in clodex patch site clears that
  bar: the transforms change six chunks on a real 2.1.246 bundle and all six GROW, at every model
  count measured (1, 2 and 3 favourites). Do not quote the individual byte deltas — they scale with
  the configured model count. A SAME-LENGTH edit, which is exactly what a local patch may be, is the
  reachable case.

Rebuilding the blob from the module structs — which is what tweakcc's repack does — keeps the flags
and drops all of it. That is what broke `clodex patch` on 2.1.246 on every platform: see
`patcher.md`.

## The entry module's name is not stable (renamed in 2.1.229)

The bundle lived in a Bun data blob as one module among ~15 (see the code-split section above for
what changed in 2.1.242), and tweakcc finds it **by name**:
`/claude`, `claude`, `/claude.exe`, `claude.exe`, `/src/entrypoints/cli.js`, `src/entrypoints/cli.js`.

| Version | Entry module |
| --- | --- |
| 2.1.224, 2.1.226, 2.1.228 | `/$bunfs/root/src/entrypoints/cli.js` |
| 2.1.229, 2.1.231–2.1.234, 2.1.241–2.1.243 | `/$bunfs/root/cli` |

(2.1.228 is the last release clodex's pinned tweakcc 4.3.0 — and clodex's own mirrored copy of its
name list — can discover, and 2.1.230 was never published for any platform package, so 2.1.229 is
where the rename actually landed. Confirmed on linux-x64 and darwin-arm64.)

2.1.229 and later match none of them, so `readContent` threw and every patch failed with
"Failed to extract JavaScript from native installation" — which reads like the `node-gyp-build`
packaging fault described in `patcher.md` and is not it. tweakcc carried the old list through
4.3.2; **4.3.3** added `/cli`, but clodex mirrors the list itself and is still pinned to 4.3.0, so
`src/bun-entry-module.ts` works around it; see `patcher.md`.

Two things that are easy to assume wrongly about the blob:

- **Every JavaScript module also carries Bun bytecode** (`// @bun @bytecode`) — ~190 MB on the
  single-module releases, a few hundred KB per chunk since the split — and the write preserves it
  verbatim for every module clodex did not patch. (A module clodex DOES patch has its bytecode
  range cleared, because since Bun 1.4.1 the recorded source hash would otherwise vouch for it.)
  It does **not** win over the patched source — a canary injected
  into the JS prints at startup on a repacked 2.1.231 (verified twice on macOS arm64 — once by
  hand and once through clodex's own local-patches feature, both printing the canary on stderr
  ahead of `--version`). Bytecode has been present since at least 2.1.226, so this was never the
  thing standing between clodex and a working patch.
- The blob's own 32-byte offsets record where it starts, and it ends with a fixed `---- Bun! ----`
  trailer, so it can be located by scanning back from EOF with no Mach-O/ELF/PE parsing at all.
  `entryPointId` names the entry module directly and survives renames; the *name* is only how
  tweakcc happens to look it up.

## Unknown-model context-window enforcement (verified 2.1.223+, re-verified 2.1.261)

In 2.1.261 the minified names are `RV` (gate) and `GS` (resolver); the pre-2.1.261 names below are
`KJe` and `Q9` respectively. Names change every build — find these by behaviour, not by symbol.

Enforcement hangs off a single gate: `KJe(e,t)` returns `Q9(e,t).source !== "auto"`. `Q9` returns
`{window, configured, source}`; the enforcement branch and the fallthrough return the **identical**
`{window, configured}` and differ only in the source string.

`KJe`'s five call sites gate the blocking branch in the query path, the autocompact check, and the
status line. **Only `"auto"` turns enforcement off** — every other source value (`unknown-model`,
`model-default`, `settings`, `clientdata`, `experiment`) leaves it on. The companion `cCe()` is true
for normal local use and false only under `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE`.

Scope: only models that fall through to the `unknown-model` branch are affected — that is exactly
clodex identities. Recognized Anthropic models hit earlier branches.

**Three consumers read the source string, not one.** Besides `KJe`, `eOv` gates the unrecognized-model
startup notice (`if (n !== "unknown-model") return null`) and the auto-compact setup wizard both
labels the source and seeds its initial value differently. Both are **cosmetic**, so `KJe` remains the
only behavioural gate — but the bundle already renders `model-default` as a first-class label.

## Where the context window and the compaction point come from (verified 2.1.261, darwin-arm64)

Names are from 2.1.261 and will change; the constants will not.

**Window** — `vp(model, betas)`, in order:
1. the `/*ccpatch:ctx*/` table `clodex patch` injects (PATCH 7 anchors here, ahead of everything else)
2. `JL()` — `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS`, but **only when `DISABLE_COMPACT` is truthy**. `Ie()`
   accepts exactly `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`, so `DISABLE_COMPACT=0` does not arm it.
3. `ivn()` — clamp to 200,000 when the account's long-context credits are blocked
4. `QL()`: `[1m]` suffix → 1e6 (via `tc`, itself gated on `KN()`) · 1m-beta header → 1e6 · served
   model catalog (`svn`/`Ya`, clamped to 200,000 unless native-1M) — a per-model experiment `sCt`
   is consulted *inside* this branch and outranks the catalog value · `_g()` native-1M → 1e6 ·
   `sCt` again · **`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` when `XL(e)`** — no `DISABLE_COMPACT` needed;
   this is the branch endpoint mode relies on, set by `src/env.ts`. `XL` is roughly "not an id the
   baked catalog recognises", not literally "does not start with `claude-`" · else 200,000

Getting step 2 and the `XL` branch confused is an easy mistake and has been made in this repo: the
env var is read in **three** places with different preconditions — those two, plus `XS`, which
gates the unrecognized-model startup notice on `eor()`, the deliberate union of both. Only the
first two decide a window; `XS` is cosmetic.

`GS()` then layers overrides. **No branch can exceed `vp`:** every override is `Math.min`'d against
it, and the remaining branches return it unchanged. Order:
`CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` (validated 100,000–1,000,000, `source:"env"`) → settings →
clientdata → experiment → model-default clamps → unknown-model → `auto`.

**Compaction point** — `threshold = GS().window − min(maxOutputTokens, 20,000) − 13,000`. A flat
reserve, 33,000 for every current model; there is **no percentage on the default path**.
`CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE` is a percent in `(0, 100]` — `parseFloat`, and anything outside
that range, including `0`, is ignored silently applied as `Math.min(floor(effective × pct/100), effective − 13,000)` — it can only
**lower** the threshold, and it multiplies the window *after* the 20,000 reserve, not the raw
window. Identical in every cached bundle from 2.1.238 to 2.1.261. The one genuine
percentage-of-window nearby (`0.2`) belongs to the speculative precompute arm, not the trigger.

Because the reserve is flat, headroom as a *fraction* varies with window size: 16.5% at 200,000,
12.1% at 272,000, 3.3% at 1,000,000.

**The response body is not a source for the window.** A few consumers do read a model id off a
response — one even calls `vp()` on it — but only to stamp a context window onto a cost record.
None of them reach `GS`/`QF`/`MTe`/`RXo`, so nothing on the compaction path depends on the echo.
The models-list fetch validates only `{id, display_name, description}`. The served-catalog lookup
`Ya()` does prefer `runtime.max_input_tokens` over `context_window`, but in endpoint mode that
lookup is unreachable anyway: it is gated on the Anthropic base URL being `api.anthropic.com`, and
`src/env.ts` points the child at `127.0.0.1`.

## The shared child-environment builder (verified 2.1.221, re-verified 2.1.239 and 2.1.260)

The shared child-env builder — `pH()` in 2.1.221, with 14 call sites there and 16 in every 2.1.239
build. The split that matters for bridge isolation:

**Its minified name, its declarator list and its statements change release to release, and the
name is not even stable across one release's eight platform builds** — `pH()` in 2.1.221,
`XH()` in 2.1.224, `$M()` in 2.1.226, `o1()` in 2.1.228, which also hoisted the settings-colour
env into its own binding (`r=<mod>.settingsColorEnv`) inside the opening `let`,
`YR()`/`JP()`/`YI()` across the builds of 2.1.238, and `nO()`/`nL()`/`rO()`/`nP()` across the
builds of 2.1.239, which moved the agent-proxy env behind a registry lookup
(`sUn.of(lr().host)`), turned the settings-colour binding into a **destructuring** declarator
(`{settingsColorEnv:n}=e`), added a second computed deny list, and **deleted** the GitHub-Actions
`INPUT_${…}` scrub from the tail entirely, and `Ai()`/`wi()`/`Es()`/`Rs()`/`Ti()` across the builds
of 2.1.260, which stopped asking `process.env` whether it is running remote and reads the flag off
the typed env accessor instead (`i=a.CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE===!0`). That is why PATCH 10's anchor
identifies the function by landmarks inside its body that survive all of that — the agent-proxy env
it folds in (`getAgentProxyEnv`, spelled inline by every measured builder from 2.1.246 on, with the
`CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` ternary the measured 2.1.238 builder uses still accepted as the alternative),
the passthrough early-out `)return process.env;let <copy>={` (counted across the
whole bundle), the back-referenced `return <copy>}` tail, and the required-literal, nested-function
and brace-balance checks — rather than by counting bindings or by naming a statement upstream is
free to delete.

**Two paths overlay the child env AFTER PATCH 10's restore, and neither is inside the builder.**
The merge is `{...<restored>,...<settingsColour>,...<agentProxy>,...<remote>}`, so the agent-proxy
helper wins over the reverted values. Its active branch returns Claude Code's own proxy and is
meant to be authoritative. Its **disabled fallback** is the one to know about: gated on ambient
`HTTPS_PROXY && SSL_CERT_FILE`, it copies the live ambient proxy variables forward — and under
clodex the ambient `HTTPS_PROXY` *is* the injection, so the bridge URL reaches the child. Verified
by executing the real helper against the patched builder on every 2.1.238 and 2.1.239 build.
Reachability is nil from clodex alone: the helper is only registered under `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE`, and
clodex sets neither that nor `SSL_CERT_FILE` (it sets only `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY` and
`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`), so both gates need the user's own environment. It is **not** fixable by
moving PATCH 10's anchor — the gate and the copy both read `process.env` outside the builder's
matched span — and would need its own patch site or a launch-side guard.

- **Shell-mediated** (reachable from a `.zshenv`-style user snippet): the Bash tool, hooks, subagent
  status line, the shell snapshot/env probe.
- **Direct binary spawns** (no shell, unreachable from any rc file): stdio MCP servers, LSP servers,
  sandboxed exec, `gh`.

That split is why a shell-rc workaround is a valid stopgap for bridge leakage but never a substitute
for PATCH 10.

**Claude Code snapshots the login shell** — `<shell> -c -l <script>` once into `shell-snapshots/`,
then reuses it. rc-derived state is captured at snapshot time and cached, and the snapshot itself is
built with `pH()` env.

**Settings-sourced env is applied AFTER any wrapper snapshot.** `S7()`/`mht()` do
`Object.assign(process.env, phr(<settings>.env, scope))` per scope, and the recorder keeps only
`NO_COLOR`/`FORCE_COLOR` — so settings-level proxy or CA values get no second chance inside `pH()`.

**The `utn()` allowlist branch is not a leak path.** Several Bash spawns use
`utn() ? {...KIs(), ...Qdt()} : pH()`, and `KIs()` copies only
`["HOME","LOGNAME","PATH","SHELL","TERM","USER"]`.

### Process-wrapper host markers (verified 2.1.273, darwin-arm64; extension 2.1.267/2.1.273)

The inspected VS Code extensions build their top-level Claude environment by setting
`CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=claude-vscode` after configured environment variables, then deleting
`CLAUDECODE` and `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION`. They invoke a configured
`claudeProcessWrapper` as the executable with the bundled Claude path prepended to the SDK
arguments. Main-chat wrapper stderr is logged to the **Claude VSCode** output channel with a
`From claude: ...` prefix. The chat SDK uses that sanitized environment directly. Extension helper
commands normally carry the same values but construct their environment as
`{...process.env, ...sanitizedEnv}`. A deletion from the sanitized copy therefore cannot remove an
ambient `CLAUDECODE` inherited by the extension host: in that unusual launch shape the chat remains
top-level while helpers retain the marker.

Nested CLI launch shapes differ. Tool, hook, and agent child environments set `CLAUDECODE` and/or
`CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION`. Background pty-host launches delete those markers but also pass their
environment through the entrypoint scrubber, which removes `claude-vscode`, `claude-desktop`, and
`claude-desktop-3p`. A wrapper can therefore identify the top-level VS Code shape by requiring the
VS Code entrypoint and neither child marker; background pty hosts are excluded by the missing
entrypoint rather than by a marker.

## `NO_PROXY` cannot solve child-env isolation (verified 2.1.221)

It has **no process dimension** — parent and children read the same variables — and it is a denylist
with no allow-list spelling. Dead ends already checked, so don't re-check them:

- `CLAUDE_CODE_PROXY_*` is a proxy **auth-helper** plus DNS interface; `CLAUDE_CODE_PROXY_URL` is
  passed *to* a helper subprocess, not read as config.
- `fallbackProxy` in `yg()` is reachable only from the MCP agent-proxy fallback.
- `ANTHROPIC_UNIX_SOCKET` genuinely avoids the proxy variables and is stripped from child env by
  Claude Code itself — but it flips the session into host-managed auth and kills keychain OAuth.

Two matcher behaviors worth knowing before touching `src/outbound-proxy.ts`: `no_proxy || NO_PROXY`
means **lowercase wins outright — do not union the casings**, and `*` is bypass-all **only as the
entire value** (a list-member `*` matches nothing).

## Terminal ownership (verified against 2.1.226 under tmux)

Parent and child share one PTY with no render lock. A live write from clodex lands mid-frame or on
the prompt, where it reads as typed input. **Sanitizing the message cannot make a live write safe** —
this is why `src/parent-notice.ts` queues rather than paints. See
`.claude/docs/launch-and-wrapper.md`.

Background pty hosts are started `detached: true` and resized via
`process.kill(-process.pid, 'SIGWINCH')` to the process group — which is why the wrapper must `exec`
rather than spawn.

## Client-side stream deadlines (verified against 2.1.259)

Claude Code applies its own deadlines independently of any server-side clodex timeout. Before
response headers, proxy-mode requests default to the smaller of roughly 180s plus 1s per 32 KiB of
request body and the Anthropic SDK's roughly 599s deadline. A foreign `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` does not
use that custom first-byte watchdog, but the SDK still defaults to 600s.

After headers, the byte-idle fallback is 180s for the first-party URL used in proxy mode and 300s
for a foreign base URL used in endpoint mode. `CLAUDE_BYTE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` and
`CLAUDE_STREAM_FIRST_BYTE_TIMEOUT_MS` are bounded to 10s–30m. The separate event watchdog defaults
to 300s and `CLAUDE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` can raise it beyond 30m, but the byte watchdog remains
the effective ceiling unless `CLAUDE_ENABLE_BYTE_WATCHDOG=false`. `API_TIMEOUT_MS` controls the SDK
request deadline. Raising a clodex server timeout alone never raises any of these client limits.

## Mid-stream error retry gate (verified 2.1.261, darwin-arm64)

What Claude Code does with an `event: error` frame that arrives after `message_start`, and why
clodex leaves a thinking block open on a WebSocket transport drop. Byte offsets are into the
extracted `claude-2.1.261-*.js` bundle.

- **The frame becomes a status-less APIError.** The Anthropic SDK's SSE reader (@83888) throws
  `new APIError(undefined, body, undefined, headers, body.error.type)`; `message` is the
  JSON-stringified body. No HTTP status is attached, so nothing that keys on `status >= 500` fires.
- **Retry keys on the type text, not the status.** `ED(e)` (@3409302) is
  `status === 529 || message.includes('"type":"overloaded_error"')`. A status-less `api_error`
  matches nothing; the request-level predicate (@7169742) has `if(!e.status)return!1` and the
  streaming catch has no branch for it. Neither path retries a status-less `api_error`.
- **A completed content block blocks the retry, whatever the type.** The streaming catch's outer gate
  (@9501970) is `if(Ac.some(block => block.type !== 'fallback') || Kn)`; both are set by
  `content_block_stop` (@9489300) for any non-fallback block, thinking included. Inside the gate,
  visible content (`Un`, set on `content_block_start` of a non-thinking block) finalizes a partial
  response; otherwise the gate's last statement (@9505233) throws with
  `fallback_cause:"partial_yield"`. Neither path retries. Replaying clodex's own bytes to `claude -p`
  gave one upstream request for a closed thinking block followed by `overloaded_error`, and one
  for `api_error`.
- **The retry lives past the gate.** `if(e instanceof APIError && ED(e))` (@9507262), log string
  "Mid-stream 529 before content", retries the stream up to `Rle=3` times (@7156910) while `Un` is
  false, then falls back to a non-streaming request. Eligible query sources (`$ve`, @2083457) are
  `undefined`, every `agent:*`, `sdk`, and the named auxiliary sources. With a fallback model
  configured, the switch happens only after the three retries are spent (@9508100). The same
  replay with the thinking block left open gave four upstream requests.
- **A subagent dies on its first API-error message** (`AgentApiErrorTerminationError`, @8197079,
  thrown at @8203646) with no agent-level retry; partial-output recovery (@8197191) applies only
  to `rate_limit`, `overloaded`, and `server_error` kinds.

So for a transport drop to be recoverable, clodex must (a) label the frame `overloaded_error`
(`anthropicErrorType` in `src/upstream-error.ts`) and (b) not emit `content_block_stop` for an
open thinking block first (`case 'error'` in `src/sdk-adapter.ts`). Either alone is inert. Text
and tool blocks are still closed: visible output already stops the retry, and a tool block's
buffered arguments must be flushed.

### Multiple thinking summaries (re-verified 2.1.263, darwin-arm64)

In the pristine `claude-2.1.263-ef5d2909c8af49f3.js` bundle, the parser sets `la` on the
start of a non-thinking, non-redacted-thinking, non-fallback block. A block stop pushes that
block's assistant-message envelope into `dc` and sets `mr`, including for thinking. The catch first tests
`dc.some(message => message.content.some(block => !isFallback(block))) || mr`.
Inside this completed-content gate, an SSE server/overload error finalizes partial output
only when `la` is true; its thinking-only case throws `Rb`, recording telemetry
`fallback_cause: "partial_yield"` instead.
The socket-error and watchdog branches have separate retry rules, but clodex's in-band
`websocket_transport_error` is an API error, not a socket error at the client.

The overload branch is still **after** that gate: `La instanceof Lt && AD(La)`, where
`AD` (@3409360) accepts status 529 or the literal `"type":"overloaded_error"` in the
message. With `la` false it increments `qp` and retries while `qp < Nle` (`Nle=3`,
@7157194), for eligible query sources, then takes the non-streaming fallback unless disabled.
Thus the ordinary exhausted path is three streaming attempts plus one non-streaming request,
not four streaming attempts. A fallback model or low-priority capacity-wait policy can alter
that path. The completed-content gate and overload branch are around @9502000–9509900.

Leaving only the **last** thinking block open is insufficient if earlier summaries already
closed blocks. Clodex now coalesces consecutive OpenAI Responses reasoning into one live
thinking block, retaining original item/summary boundaries in an opaque signature envelope.
The stream parser treats signatures as opaque strings (`sl.signature = hp.signature`) and appends
thinking text verbatim; it does not understand or decode that envelope. This is not a guarantee
of byte-exact request replay: immediately before sending a request, `oot`/`wZ` recursively scan
all string values and replace lone UTF-16 surrogates with U+FFFD (@211704–212238 and @9461968).
Clodex therefore keeps the original summary strings inside its JSON-encoded signature, whose
escaped surrogate code units survive that sanitizer, rather than depending on unchanged display
text or sanitizing individual deltas (which would break valid pairs split across deltas).

## Voice dictation transport (verified 2.1.263, darwin-arm64)

How the dictation client reaches the network, read from the extracted `claude-2.1.263-*.js` bundle
while reviewing #188. This is why proxy mode must relay a WebSocket upgrade and endpoint mode does
not have to.

- **The voice URL never follows `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`.** The client dials
  `VOICE_STREAM_BASE_URL || <oauth-config>.BASE_API_URL` with `https://` rewritten to `wss://`
  (@27520823), path `/api/ws/speech_to_text/voice_stream`. That base is the OAuth-config module's
  hardcoded `https://api.anthropic.com`; `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` appears 77 times in the bundle and
  never in that module. So endpoint mode, which points `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` at the local gateway and
  strips `HTTP(S)_PROXY`, sends voice straight to Anthropic and needs no gateway support.
- **The socket is Bun's native WebSocket behind a `ws` shim, not npm `ws`.** The module imports
  `ws` bare and passes `{headers, proxy, tls}`; the shim forwards those to Bun's client. The
  `proxy` value comes from the same env resolver the HTTP client uses (the `HTTPS_PROXY` family,
  honouring `NO_PROXY`), with nothing platform-specific, so macOS and Windows both CONNECT through
  clodex in proxy mode. `tls.ca` is built explicitly from `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` plus bundled and
  system roots (@1604656, @1605611, @1609521); there is no `rejectUnauthorized:false` on the path,
  so a bad CA fails closed rather than silently.
- **Nothing is sent before the 101.** `send()` drops frames unless `readyState === OPEN`, audio
  captured while connecting is queued outside the socket, and the first frame (`KeepAlive`) is
  written from the `open` handler. The client's parser `head` on an upgrade is therefore always
  empty for this client; the relay's `head`/`upstreamHead` forwarding is hardening, not a
  production path.
- **Failure mapping.** An HTTP response instead of a 101 goes through the `unexpected-response`
  handler (@27524262) and renders as `Voice stream error: WebSocket upgrade rejected with HTTP
  <status>`; only 4xx is marked fatal, anything else is retried once after 250 ms. The friendly
  "Voice connection failed. Check your network and try again." comes from a recording-level selector
  (@27531209) that fires when a >2 s recording ends with audio but the socket never connected —
  which is exactly what a hung handshake produces. The handshake itself sits on Bun's native
  `BUN_CONFIG_WS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT`, default 120 s.
- **Why main hung (Node, not Claude Code).** An `http(s).Server` with no `upgrade` listener does
  *not* close the connection on Node >= 22.11; it falls the request through to the ordinary request
  handler. clodex's passthrough then made an `https.request` with no `upgrade` listener of its own,
  so when the origin answered 101 Node destroyed that socket and `response` never fired, leaving
  the client waiting on the 120 s timeout above. Verified on 22.11.0, 22.14.0 and 24.14.1.

## Tool-call arguments are rewritten at ingest (verified 2.1.273; captured 2.1.267, 2.1.270, 2.1.273)

The arguments a tool call is *echoed* with are not the arguments the model emitted. When an assistant
message arrives from the API, the client rewrites every `tool_use.input` against the tool's schema
and stores the rewritten form; the next request sends that. This is what #214 (defaults filled) and
#225 (strings re-typed) reconcile in clodex. Line numbers are from
`claude-2.1.273-darwin-arm64.js`; the bundle's own functions were executed with its zod (4.4.3) and
the behaviour captured against a synthetic Anthropic-format server with each pristine binary in
`~/.tweakcc`, in bypass mode, under `--allowedTools` and under `acceptEdits`.

- **Where.** `Zq` (L12581) runs on every assistant message (call sites: four on L11543 and the
  streamed tool-use path on L9596). For each `tool_use` whose tool is in the current tool list it
  applies, inside one `try`:
  1. `qKe` → `OYs` (L12552), a generic per-property repair that runs on **every** tool: a string
     value is JSON-parsed and kept when the parse yields the kind the zod shape (or an MCP tool's
     JSON schema, resolved by `cMt` — `type` string or array, `$ref` into `$defs`/`definitions`,
     `anyOf`/`oneOf`, with array/object preferred, then string, then the first non-null scalar) declares
     for that top-level property — array, object, boolean (no print-back check, one BOM strip), or a
     finite number that prints back identically (`String(parsed) === raw`, integral for `integer`).
     `optional`/`nullable`/`default` wrappers are unwrapped; a `preprocess` pipe resolves to
     `"transform"` and is **skipped**, which is what limits coverage on built-ins. An annotation-only
     property (`{description}`) counts as `"any"` and is re-typed too.
  2. `rW` (L11539), per tool: **Read** re-types `offset` only through `UF` (`limit` stays a string —
     captured); **Bash** runs the whole input through its strict schema, whose `timeout` carries
     `_H` = `z.preprocess(UF)` (L9822: trim — which also strips U+FEFF — then
     `/^[-+]?\d+(\.\d+)?$/` and `Number()`) and whose `run_in_background` /
     `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` carry `sw` = `z.preprocess(k1)` (L7356: exactly `"true"`/`"false"`),
     then rebuilds the object (also stripping a `cd <cwd> &&` prefix and rewriting `\\;` → `\;` in
     `command`); **Edit** parses through its schema, filling `replace_all: false` and folding
     `old_str`/`new_str` aliases; **Write**, **TaskOutput** (fills `block ?? true`,
     `timeout ?? 30000`) and **ExitPlanMode** have their own cases.
  If `rW` throws, the catch at L12581 keeps the `qKe` result and skips the per-tool step wholesale.
  Bash's schema is a strict object, so **one uncoercible value or one unknown key means the
  per-tool step is skipped and the transcript keeps the generic repair's output** — the scalar
  strings untouched, unknown key included (captured: `foo:"bar"` echoed with every scalar
  untouched). It does not drop the key; it is not necessarily the exact model input either, since
  the generic repair (and its double-escaped-unicode pass) may already have changed another field.
- **Which tools are re-typed on the transcript.** Bash (`timeout` and its two booleans, via `rW`),
  Read (`offset` only), ToolSearch (`max_results`, plain schema → generic repair; captured `"5"`→`5`),
  Agent (`run_in_background`, plain), TaskOutput (filled), Monitor/ExitWorktree/LSP/REPL (plain
  scalars), and every MCP tool with a number/integer/boolean property. **Not** re-typed:
  PowerShell, Grep and CronCreate — all their scalars are `_H`/`sw` preprocess pipes, which the
  generic repair skips, and they have no `rW` case (captured: Grep `head_limit:"5"` echoed as a
  string). ScheduleWakeup's `delaySeconds` is a pipe too; only its plain `stop`/`noop` are re-typed.
- **The wire schema hides all of this.** Every pipe appears as plain `{type:"number"|"integer"|
  "boolean"}`; 11 of the 12 built-in schemas carry `additionalProperties:false`. A server cannot tell
  which client rule a property falls under.
- **Not the permission path.** Bypass mode and `--allowedTools` echo identical rewritten arguments
  (Bash and Edit, all three versions). The tool runner's `inputSchema.safeParse` (L10117,
  `He=De.data` L10119) feeds permission checks and `tool.call`; neither it nor a decision's
  `updatedInput` is written into `tool_use.input`.
- **The wire-echo flag.** The raw wire input is also kept (`aFe`, L9197, as `wireToolInputs` on the
  message). When `echoWireToolInputs` is on — `wI()` (L9197): env `CLAUDE_CODE_HUMBLE_HAMMOCK`, else
  GrowthBook `tengu_humble_hammock`, default `false` — **and** the request builder's consistency
  gate passes (L12575 → `sNr`, L12552; for Bash, `qYs` tolerates exactly the `UF`/`k1` coercions,
  the `\;` rewrite and the cwd strip), the builder sends the raw input instead; the flag alone is
  not sufficient. Captured with the env var set: Bash
  echoes `"5000"` / `"false"` and Edit echoes without `replace_all`. clodex therefore normalizes both
  sides rather than snapshotting one shape.

Captured pairs (bypass mode, 2.1.273; identical on 2.1.267 and 2.1.270 where marked):

| model emitted | echoed | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bash `{"command":"ls","timeout":"5000","run_in_background":"false"}` | `{"command":"ls","run_in_background":false,"timeout":5000}` | 267/270/273 |
| Bash `timeout` `"5000.0"`, `" 5000 "`, `"05"`, `"+5"` | `5000`, `5000`, `5`, `5` | 273 |
| Bash `{"command":"ls","timeout":"abc","run_in_background":"false"}` | unchanged | |
| Bash `{"command":"ls","timeout":"5000.0","run_in_background":"0"}` | unchanged (`"0"` fails, so nothing is re-typed) | |
| Bash `{...,"run_in_background":"False",...,"foo":"bar"}` | unchanged, `foo` kept | |
| Read `{"file_path":"/etc/hosts","offset":"5","limit":"10"}` | `{"file_path":"/etc/hosts","limit":"10","offset":5}` | 267/270/273 |
| Read `offset` `"5.5"`, `"05"`, `" 5 "` | `5.5`, `5`, `5` | 273 |
| ToolSearch `max_results:"5"` | `5` | 273 |
| Grep `head_limit:"5"` | unchanged | 273 |
| Edit `{file_path,old_string,new_string}` | `+ "replace_all":false` | 267/270/273 |

## The hook banner is one render frame per hook, whatever the hook does (verified 2.1.273, darwin-arm64)

`running PreToolUse hook` is drawn dim inside the spinner's parentheses, as the spinner's *suffix*:
`✻ Doing things… (running PreToolUse hook · 12s · 1.2k tokens)`. Read out of a real 2.1.273 bundle.

**Measured 2026-09-18 through a real Claude Code on a pty, spinner line sampled every 1.5 ms** (the
same harness the thinking-spinner work used). With every hook disabled: **0** appearances. With the
real Orca hook config: **16**, each visible ~32 ms. A hook whose command is `sleep 0.02`: 18, ~57 ms
median. A hook backgrounded with `( sleep 1.2 ) & printf '{}\n'`: 12, ~35 ms each. One with the
`async: true` field: 15. **So the banner's duration is not the hook's duration** — shortening the
hook does not remove the flash and backgrounding does not either.

**The data path.** The suffix comes from one function, `Fjt` in the extracted bundle
(`function Fjt(h){let E=h.findLast((Re)=>Re.agentId===void 0);…}`; 332 bytes, unique). It has exactly
one caller — `let Ojt=Me(MGo,Fjt)` in the component `Ame` — and its return value becomes the
spinner's `spinnerSuffix` prop. Its records come from `PZe`, a `using`-scoped tracker:

```js
function PZe({hookEvent:e,hooks:n,agentId:r}){let s=j_o(),d={hookEvent:e,hooks:n,settled:new Set,agentId:r};return s.setState((h)=>[...h,d]),{settle:(h)=>…,[Symbol.dispose]:()=>…}}
```

**There is no time anywhere on that path.** The record holds `hookEvent`, `hooks`, `settled` and
`agentId`; `settle` only grows a `Set`. The per-hook `Date.now()` reads all live in the *executor*
(`let …=Date.now()` at the top of each hook's run) and are consumed only to stamp `durationMs` on an
already-finished hook's attachment. A wrapper therefore cannot gate the banner from outside the
bundle — the start time has to be added at the writer.

**The gate cannot simply read the clock, because the selector is memoised.** `Me` is a caching
`useSyncExternalStore` wrapper:

```js
if(o!==null&&o.snapshot===n&&o.select===s)return o.selected
```

The snapshot (the record array) changes only on create, settle and dispose, so a `Date.now()` read
inside `Fjt` is computed at those three moments and frozen in between — a hook that blocks for a
minute would never start showing. Handing the hook a fresh selector each render is the other way to
force recomputation, and it is the wrong one: it makes `getSnapshot` non-idempotent, the documented
footgun for that hook. The re-render has to arrive as a real snapshot change, which is why the
banner delay is two patch sites rather than one.

**`statusMessage` is a documented hook field** on every hook variant in the settings schema
(`"Custom status message to display in spinner while hook runs"`), read by `pZe` and honoured by
`Fjt`'s early return. It is set by the user, so it is not a lever clodex can use.

**The tool timer is the precedent for a gate.** `Vn` refuses to show `running tool for 12s` until
`if(l>=2000)` in both directions. That `2000` is an inline bare literal, not a named constant —
mirroring it means spelling the number, not `2e3`.

## The advisor tool goes to every upstream (verified 2.1.278, darwin-arm64)

2.1.278 added an advisor: a second, stronger model the assistant can consult mid-turn, executed
server-side by Anthropic. Three gates decide whether it is on, all in `Kdt`/`sb`:
`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADVISOR_TOOL` unset, `Oe()==="firstParty"`, and either the
`tengu_sage_compass2` flag or `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_ADVISOR_TOOL`. Nothing in the chain
asks where the request is going.

It also pushes the `advisor-tool-2026-03-01` beta (`ZCn=Pe("advisor_tool",…)`, under
`if(Kdt()&&(sb()||h.advisorModel!==void 0))`), so the header travels with the block. OpenCode Go
answers 200 with that beta present and no advisor block, so the header is not part of the failure.

**The declaration.** Once an advisor model resolves, the request builder appends
`{type:"advisor_20260301",name:"advisor",model:<advisor id>,defer_loading?:true}` to the tools array
— `Dp=[...h.extraToolSchemas??[]];if(Mo)Dp.push(...)`, then `kl=[...or,...Dp]`. It is always last,
and carries neither `input_schema` nor `cache_control`: `EOt`, the rewrite the array passes through
on the way to the request, returns its input untouched off the Foundry path. In proxy mode Claude
Code keeps its Anthropic auth, so `firstParty` holds and the block goes out on requests clodex
routes elsewhere.

**What the history then carries.** An advisor turn leaves two block kinds in the assistant message:
`server_tool_use` with `name:"advisor"`, and `advisor_tool_result`, whose `content` is a single
object (`{type:"advisor_result"|"advisor_redacted_result"|"advisor_tool_result_error",…}`), not an
array. Those two are the only advisor types in the content-block whitelist; the rest are nested
inside that object.

**Its own recoveries never fire for a third-party upstream.** `THe` (bad result content), `Sue`
(tool unavailable) and `x5` (advisor incompatible with the request model) each require
`status === 400` *and* an Anthropic-worded message. An upstream that rejects the block with anything
else — OpenCode Go answers the declaration and the result block with `422 {"model":"<id>"}` and the
`server_tool_use` block with `400 {"model":"<id>"}` — matches none of them, so the turn just dies.

**The recovery shape, when it does fire.** `cD` drops `advisor_tool_result` and `server_tool_use`
blocks named `advisor` from assistant messages, and when that leaves a message empty or holding only
thinking and blank text it appends `{type:"text",text:"[Advisor response]",citations:[]}`.
`src/third-party-anthropic-body.ts` mirrors that rule.

## Artifact's `file_paths` regex kills a Go DeepSeek session from `hello` (verified 2.1.278, darwin-arm64)

2.1.278's Artifact tool constrains `file_paths` items with `pattern: "^[^\\0]*$"`. Artifact is
interactive-only — a `-p` run, a subagent or a background agent never sends it, which is why the
headless probe answered while the TUI died on its first turn — and it ships on every interactive
request, so nothing the user types can avoid it.

**What rejects it, measured 2026-09-22 against `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/messages`.**
`deepseek-v4.1-flash` answers HTTP 400 `{"model":"deepseek-v4.1-flash"}` — no message, the same
opaque body as the advisor and `tool_addition` rejections — to any request carrying an octal
escape inside a character class: `[^\\0]` and `[^\\101]` both 400. The hex, unicode and
out-of-class spellings pass (`[^\\x00]`, `[^\\u0000]`, `a\\0b` all 200). `minimax-m3` and
`qwen3.7-max` on the same endpoint accept the untouched body, so this is one backend's regex
dialect, not Go's request validation. Python's `re` compiles `\\0`, so the OpenAI-facing scanner
in `src/tool-schema-sanitize.ts` did not recognise it, and the raw Anthropic-format relay in
`src/proxy.ts`/`src/server/router.ts` never ran the scanner at all — only the SDK translation path
did. Both are closed: `anthropicBodyForUpstream` now sanitizes tool schemas for any non-Anthropic
upstream, and the scanner drops a backslash-digit escape inside a class.

**Not the cause, each ruled out on the live endpoint:** the `role: "system"` message in `messages`
(a SessionStart hook's output; Go accepts it), `thinking.display: "updates"`, `context_management`,
`diagnostics`, `cache_control.scope: "global"`, the `DeferredToolPlaceholder` tool, and the
`x-claude-code-session-id` header. Bisect the body — see the memory note on replaying variants
with the stored key — rather than reason from the field names; three of those looked new and
guilty and were neither.

## Things that looked like clodex bugs and were not (not version-specific)

- **"Concurrent subagents died at turn 2" was not unknown-model classification.** The agents' first
  tool call injected ~230k tokens of bundled-skill content into a 272k-window model, exceeding any
  threshold. Enforcement was reporting a real problem. Check the actual prefix size before theorising
  about window plumbing.
- **A zero-usage symptom in the client is upstream's.** clodex floors `input_tokens` with
  `estimateAnthropicInputTokens` on both translation paths and retains it at `finish`; the client's
  usage merge is last-non-zero-wins and yields the assistant event once.

## The quota manager is one per process and has no model identity (verified 2.1.273, darwin-arm64)

The usage-limit banner ("You've used 98% of your weekly limit · resets …") comes from
`anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` on **successful Messages responses**. There is no model field anywhere
in the chain: `Dar` (the process-wide manager behind `Gb`) keeps one `currentLimits` plus a
`lastSeenWindows` map, and the last successful response wins.

**Where the values come from.** `avt` → `Gb.extractQuotaStatusFromHeaders` is called from the response
handler in the streaming loop, for both the main turn and background calls. `gvt` returns `null`
unless `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-status` or `-overage-status` is present, so a response carrying
neither is inert.

**What actually raises the banner.** `allowed_warning` is normalized to `allowed` on ingest
(`Qe.status = r === "allowed_warning" ? "allowed" : r`). The signal is the per-window
`-surpassed-threshold`, or `utilization` plus elapsed time against `rRs` (5h: 0.90 with ≤72% of the
window elapsed; 7d: 0.75/0.60, 0.50/0.35, or 0.25/0.15). `tRs` renders `You've used {n}% of your
{limit}` for `five_hour`/`seven_day`/`seven_day_opus`/`seven_day_sonnet`/`seven_day_overage_included`;
`o$` labels them. The render floor is `kar = 0.7`.

**A stripped reading is not inert — the held window keeps it alive.** `recordSeenWindows` stores each
window with an `observedAtMs`, and `currentWindows` re-derives from `lastSeenWindows` for anything
observed within `sRs = 30 minutes`. `deriveTrackedLimits` runs that re-derivation (`xar`, the
`tengu_sharded_moonbeam` flag) even when the current response carried no quota headers. So a Go
session that receives the Claude plan's numbers once keeps showing the Claude banner for up to 30
minutes after those headers stop arriving. Replacing the headers with an inert `allowed` status is an
observation that retires the warning; deleting them is not.

**Background calls carry the same session id as the main turn.** Claude Code's title generation and
side queries reach the proxy as passthrough requests with `x-claude-code-request-class: auxiliary`
(0 tools) and the *same* `x-claude-code-session-id` as the `main` turn, so they cannot be attributed
by session id alone. `main` + `claude-haiku-4-5-*` is a real user turn and must be left alone.

**`/api/oauth/usage` does not drive this banner.** It populates `cachedUsageUtilization`, read only by
`mQe` (`/usage` and the status line) and only when `sU()` has no `five_hour`/`seven_day` window. Its
path spellings are `plain`, `at_wall` (`?at_wall=1&skip_spend=1`) and `cedar_ember`
(`?cedar_ember=1&skip_spend=1`). Answering it locally would not change the limit banner.

**Do not synthesize `rejected`.** It sends the client down its quota-error path, which replaces the
provider's message and offers Claude-only recovery actions (upgrade, usage credits).
