# Patcher

`src/patcher.ts` + `src/patch-transforms.ts` + `src/built-in-patch-proofs.ts` +
`src/local-patches.ts` + `src/patch-backup.ts` + `src/bun-entry-module.ts` + `src/bun-bundle.ts` +
`src/npm-shim.ts` + `src/claude-native-placeholder.ts`.

`clodex patch` uses tweakcc's programmatic API — an exact-pinned, declared runtime dependency
(externalized in `tsup.config.ts`; it brings `node-lief` for native repacking and `ink`/`react` for
its picker, which is why `patcher.ts` loads it via lazy `import()`). **Never `npx`, never the
network.** Flow: `tryDetectInstallation({ path })` → `readClaudeBundle` → `applyClodexPatches(source,
config)` (in-process pure function applying built-in PATCH 1–10 sites) → optional
`applyLocalPatches` transaction with built-in postcondition verification → `writeContent` (repacks
the native binary, here only to resize its Bun section) → `applyBundleWritePlan` (publishes the
pristine blob with every patched module's source appended over that section). Both
layers return per-site OK/SKIP/FAIL results shown by `--trace`. Since 2.1.229, the reads and the
repack are each wrapped in the entry-module shim below, without which tweakcc cannot find the
bundle at all.

tweakcc ships no `.d.ts` despite its `types` field — `src/tweakcc.d.ts` declares the verified API
surface; re-verify when bumping the pin. `node-gyp-build` is a deliberate direct dependency even
though no clodex source imports it: a node-lief release demoted it to a devDependency while still
`require`-ing it at runtime (reported against 1.3.1; the lockfile currently resolves 1.3.0), so
fresh installs resolved a node-lief throwing
`Cannot find module 'node-gyp-build'` — which tweakcc's lazy loader swallows into a null and clodex
surfaces as the misleading "Failed to extract JavaScript from native installation" (the same message
a module-name mismatch produces, so read the entry-module section below before chasing this one).
Declaring it
ourselves guarantees it lands somewhere node-lief's `require` can resolve — that is the invariant to
check any alternative fix against, which matters because this repo uses pnpm's strict non-hoisted
layout with exact pins. Keep it even after node-lief fixes the packaging.

The built-ins bake favorites + aliases into the binary: model validation, `/model` listing, alias
resolution, context windows via a `/*ccpatch:ctx*/`-marked map, per-model effort
capabilities/defaults, and child-command network isolation.

## The bundle is many modules (`bun-bundle.ts`)

Claude Code 2.1.242 code-split its bundle — one ~28 MB Bun module became a ~20 KB entry stub plus
~1,374 `chunk-*.js` siblings. tweakcc reads and writes exactly ONE module, the one it recognizes by
name, so `clodex patch` started seeing a stub with none of its anchors in it and aborted at
`PATCH 1` on all eight published builds at once. `.claude/docs/claude-code-internals.md` has the
bundle-side detail and the module counts.

`bun-bundle.ts` keeps the old contract: `readClaudeBundle` reads every module Bun will execute as
JavaScript and joins them with a ``/*clodex:module-boundary`;{}"]*/`` line, `applyClodexPatches` still sees
one document, and `splitBundleSource` cuts it back up. **The transforms did not change and must not
have to.** A patched document with the wrong number of boundaries is a hard failure, not a best
effort: a boundary consumed by an anchor would silently move code between modules.

**Selection is by Bun's loader id, not by name.** Only `loader === 1` — what Bun executes as
JavaScript — is part of the bundle. The vendored assets (`mermaid.min.js`,
`hljsBundle.generated.min.js`, `chart.umd.min.js`) are `.js` files that Bun never runs, and feeding
megabytes of foreign JavaScript to anchors that must match exactly once is a way to invent
ambiguity and refuse a release that is perfectly patchable. Two consequences follow, and the second
is easy to miss: **a module's position in the blob table is not its position in the bundle**, so
every repoint is addressed by table index; and **the read corpus grew for old releases too** — a
pre-split blob holds five ~2 KB loader-1 stubs (`image-processor.js`, `audio-capture.js`,
`url-handler.js`, `computer-use-*.js`) beside the bundle, which tweakcc's read never included.
Checked on a real 2.1.232: none of them contains any anchor, any `process.env` read, or anything
the whole-bundle count guards in PATCH 5 and PATCH 10 look at.

**The write does not rebuild the blob. It resizes the section and publishes the pristine bytes.**
(One path still does: when `readClaudeBundle` returns null, `patcher.ts` falls back to tweakcc's own
single-module `writeContent`. That is the correct path for an npm `cli.js` install, and on a native
2.1.242-or-later binary it cannot publish anything — the module tweakcc recognizes is the ~20 KB
stub, so `PATCH 1` fails first and the patch aborts before any write.)

tweakcc's `writeContent` rebuilds the Bun blob's payload region from the per-module
`{ offset, length }` pairs and the exec-argv string, renumbering every offset. (It does carry
`entryPointId`, `flags` and each module's loader/encoding/format/side across — but those are
scalars, not regions.) Through Bun 1.4.0 that was close enough to lossless. Bun 1.4.1 (Claude Code
2.1.246) added a source-hash array and a builtin-bytecode table after the module table, plus an
8-byte record pointing at a ~9.9 MB shared bytecode string table written among the payloads —
announced in the blob's `flags` and reachable from no module range. The rebuild kept the flags,
dropped all of it, and Bun segfaulted reading what was no longer there.
`.claude/docs/claude-code-internals.md` has the layout.

So the blob is published, not rebuilt:

- Calling `writeContent` once per changed module is still not an alternative. Each ELF repack
  relocates the whole ~290 MB blob to `align(nextVirtualAddress())` and extends the segment, so six
  of them would leave a multi-gigabyte `claude` and take minutes. Mach-O and PE assign in place, so
  this is invisible on macOS and Windows — the same asymmetry that hid the restore-sweep bug.
- **tweakcc's repack is used for exactly one thing: making the container's Bun section big enough.**
  That is the part that needs node-lief and knows Mach-O from ELF from PE. What it is handed is a
  PLACEHOLDER (`/*clodex:placeholder*/`), sized so the section it produces has room for the blob
  clodex is about to write, and every byte of the blob it produces is then overwritten. The
  section's own 8-byte length header is the one thing kept: Bun reads the blob's length from it, so
  the published blob is padded to exactly the length it declares.
- **`planBundleWrite` reads the blob's whole data region and appends.** Each patched module's source
  goes past the end of the pristine bytes, 8-byte aligned, NUL-terminated, and its module struct is
  repointed at it. Nothing that was already in the blob moves, so everything clodex does not
  understand — the tail structures, the 128-byte bytecode alignment, whatever Bun adds next —
  survives by construction rather than by being enumerated.
- **A patched module's cached bytecode and module info are cleared, and its source hash zeroed.**
  On 2.1.246 the stale bytecode WINS over changed source — measured both ways on a real binary, see
  `claude-code-internals.md` — because Bun 1.4.1 records the hash JSC keys its code cache on instead
  of computing it from the source that is there. An empty bytecode range leaves Bun no choice but to
  compile what it finds. JSC's key also carries the source length, so an edit that changes a
  module's length is rejected anyway; that covers every built-in patch site but NOT a same-length
  local patch, which is the reachable case this closes.
- **`SOURCE_TEXT_CONTIGUOUS` is cleared** because the appended sources make it false. It is only a
  `madvise` hint; a blob that does not claim it simply does not get the hint.
- **The published blob is the same total length as the section tweakcc produced**, so the trailer
  ends exactly where it did. Everything between the last appended source and the offsets struct is
  padding. Bun takes the blob's length from the section's own 8-byte header on all three formats —
  `macho::get_data` and `elf::get_data` read it directly and the PE binding returns the same `u64`
  and data at header + 8 — so the length is the one tweakcc wrote, and the blob clodex publishes
  never leaves slack after its own trailer. (The PE *container* may: a pristine `.bun` carries a few
  hundred bytes of `FileAlignment` padding past the trailer, which Bun ignores because the header
  is what bounds the blob.)
- **The repack has to put the blob back at the same offset modulo 128.** Every unpatched module
  keeps its cached bytecode where it was, and JSC decodes that in place at a 128-byte boundary; Bun
  writes each range at `120 mod 128` from the blob's start, which lands correctly only because of
  how the section base is aligned — ELF and Mach-O map a section at `vaddr ≡ fileoff (mod
  pagesize)`, and a PE section's file offset is `FileAlignment`-aligned, at least 512. All of those
  are multiples of 128, which is why comparing FILE offsets is sound for a requirement that is
  really about the mapped address. Mach-O and PE assign in place and ELF relocates to a page-aligned
  address, so all three preserve the residue today (measured on real 2.1.245 and 2.1.246 builds) —
  but nothing else in the verification could see one that did not, and the result would be a claude
  that starts and then dies inside JSC. So it is checked.
- **The cost is file size, and it is not the same on every format.** The pristine copy of every
  patched module's source stays in the blob as dead space, so on Mach-O and PE — where the repack
  assigns the section in place — a patched binary grows by roughly the size of the modules that
  changed: +7.5 MB on 2.1.246 (230,824,016 to 238,390,496 on darwin-arm64; +7.5 MB on win32-x64),
  and +28 MB on a pre-split release where the one module IS the bundle. **On ELF the published
  binary is ~1.75x pristine** (247,389,632 to 434,470,336 on linux-arm64 2.1.246) because tweakcc
  relocates the whole blob to the end of the file and strands the original — that predates this
  change and predates the shim, and what this change adds to it is the same appended sources. The
  candidate IS the published binary on every format: `patcher.ts` renames it into place.
- `applyBundleWritePlan` refuses rather than publishing a doubtful blob: the module tweakcc wrote
  has to hold exactly the placeholder (which is also what proves the located blob is the one the
  repack just wrote, not a stale trailer left above it), the module table has to have the same
  names in the same order, the section has to be big enough, and afterwards every patched module is
  read back through the same parser Bun's loader agrees with.
- **The publish is a write AFTER tweakcc's repack, which signs on its way out.** Restoring the
  entry-module name re-signs and covers the normal path; `resignMachOBinary` covers the binary that
  needed no shim. Skip either and macOS refuses to start the result.
- The sizing arithmetic in `repackedBlobBytes` mirrors code clodex does not own. It is a hint, not a
  contract: a tweakcc whose repack lays the blob out differently produces a section that is too
  small, and the patch refuses instead of publishing a truncated blob. 64 KiB of slack absorbs
  drift too small to be worth a release.
- **"Bun runs the module SOURCE, not the bytecode that sits beside it" was true through 2.1.245 and
  is FALSE from 2.1.246.** The old paragraph here said that guarantee had no automated coverage,
  could not get any, and had to be re-checked on a real binary whenever the write path changed. It
  was re-checked, and it had stopped being true — so the instruction stays, and so does this note
  that following it is what caught this.
  Measured on a pristine 2.1.246 darwin-arm64: rewriting all 1,659 occurrences of the version string
  in the JavaScript to the same-length `2.1.XXX`, leaving every bytecode range and source hash
  alone, then re-signing, still prints `2.1.246` — the stale compiled form runs. The identical edit
  with each touched module's bytecode, module info and source hash cleared prints `2.1.XXX`. Bun
  1.4.1 records the hash JSC keys its code cache on instead of computing it from the source that is
  there, which is the whole difference.
  The bound is that JSC's key also carries the source LENGTH, so an edit that changes a module's
  length is rejected whatever the hash says. That covers every built-in patch site — the transforms
  change six chunks on 2.1.246 and all six grow, at every model count measured — but NOT a
  same-length local patch. (The per-site deltas scale with the configured model count, so quoting
  them would be quoting one config.) clodex no longer depends on any of it for the modules it patches, because their bytecode is
  cleared; an unpatched module keeps its bytecode and its hash exactly as shipped.
  **This is why a patch that "applied 11 sites" and produces a binary that starts is not evidence of
  anything.** On this release the only thing that distinguishes a working patch from a silent no-op
  is running the patched binary beside a pristine one and diffing what they emit.
  The technique that works, offline, with no credentials: point both at a stand-in Anthropic
  endpoint (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port>`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-fake`) that logs the
  request body and answers `/v1/messages` with a one-token SSE reply, run
  `claude --model <alias> -p hi` against each, and diff the `Agent` tool's `model` schema in the two
  bodies. A patched binary emits the clodex aliases in its `enum` and description; a pristine one
  emits four. Do NOT use `--version` or `--help` (byte-identical between the two) or the model id on
  the wire (passed through unvalidated by both).

## The Bun blob-pointer stand-in (`bun-compiled-pointer.ts`)

ELF only, and a no-op on every release where tweakcc works unaided.

A Bun standalone ELF keeps the virtual address of its `.bun` section in an 8-byte little-endian
global. `repackELFSection` moves `.bun` to a fresh page past the end of the file and rewrites that
global to match — and it finds it by scanning the first
writable `PT_LOAD` for eight bytes equal to `.bun`'s current address, **only at addresses that are
multiples of 16384**. tweakcc 4.3.0 and 4.3.3 both do this, so bumping the pin does not help.

Through Claude Code 2.1.252 the global happened to land on a 16 KiB boundary on every ELF build
(measured on 2.1.246 and 2.1.252, x64 and arm64, glibc and musl — all at `vaddr % 16384 == 0`).
2.1.257 moved it off one on all four: `0x534f758` linux-x64, `0x4d9af08` linux-x64-musl,
`0x5310758` linux-arm64, `0x4c46d10` linux-arm64-musl. The strided scan steps over it and
`repackELFSection` throws `Could not find original BUN_COMPILED location in binary`. **Alignment is
not something Bun promises; it was luck, and it ran out.**

So clodex plants a copy of the value the scan is looking for at an address the scan does visit,
remembers the eight bytes it displaced, and after the repack copies the address tweakcc wrote onto
the global's real home and puts the displaced bytes back. The published binary differs from an
unaided repack in exactly one place: the global, holding the value it was always meant to hold.

- **The real global is identified, not guessed:** the ONE 8-byte occurrence of `.bun`'s address
  inside the writable segment and outside `.bun`'s own payload. Occurrences inside the payload are
  coincidences in compressed JavaScript — up to five on the arm64 builds measured (0, 0, 5 and 3
  across the four 2.1.257 ELF builds) — and are excluded by range. Anything other than exactly one
  candidate is refused rather than patched.
- **It never runs where tweakcc already lands on that same address**, so an older release — or a
  future one that goes back to being aligned — takes the path it always took, byte for byte. The
  order matters: the census above runs **first** and the no-op check defers to it. Reversed, a
  build carrying a coincidental copy of the blob address at a 16384-aligned offset would make
  clodex stand aside while the repack rewrote that copy, and `clodex patch` would report success.
  No shipped build does — on all four 2.1.257 ELF builds every occurrence is unaligned, and on
  2.1.252 the single aligned hit *is* the global — and the ordering is what keeps that a measured
  fact rather than an assumption.
- **The restore verifies rather than assumes:** the stand-in must have changed, must agree with
  where `.bun` actually ended up, and both writes must read back.

**What a wrong answer actually costs.** Not a binary that fails to start. That was this section's
original claim and it is wrong: on published 2.1.257 linux-x64 and linux-x64-musl, reverting *only*
the global to its pre-repack value still yields a `claude` that starts and prints its version, so
Bun locates the blob another way — the end-of-file trailer scan described above. The cost is eight
bytes of **live data** rewritten and never put back. Nothing in range is spare: the stand-in slot
lands in `.data` on the glibc builds and in `.tdata`, the TLS initialisation image, on the musl
ones. Refusing beats guessing for that reason, not the other one.
- Mach-O and PE never reach this code — they assign the section in place and rewrite no pointer.
  That asymmetry is why the failure was ELF-only, and why the probe must be run per format.

`tests/bun-compiled-pointer.test.ts` covers the rules on hand-built ELF64 files. Only
`scripts/probe-patch-mechanism.mjs` and the canary's container leg cover a real 300 MB build, and
only the container leg starts the result.

## The entry-module shim (`bun-entry-module.ts`)

tweakcc finds the module holding the bundle **by name**, and Claude Code 2.1.229 renamed it from
`/$bunfs/root/src/entrypoints/cli.js` to `/$bunfs/root/cli`, which none of tweakcc's six accepted
names match — so `readContent` threw and 2.1.229 and later could not be patched at all. (2.1.228 is
the last `discoverable` release; 2.1.230 was never published.)
tweakcc **4.3.3** added `/cli` to that list, but bumping the pin alone changes nothing: clodex
mirrors the accepted-name list in `tweakccRecognizesModuleName` and it has no `/cli`, so the shim
keeps firing until it is deleted. `.claude/docs/claude-code-internals.md` has the bundle-side
detail. **Delete this shim once the tweakcc pin reaches 4.3.3, or once tweakcc identifies the module
by `entryPointId`.**

The name is used for identification only, so `shimEntryModuleName` swaps it for a stand-in of
**identical byte length** (`/clodex--/claude` for a 16-byte original) that tweakcc does recognize,
and `restoreEntryModuleName` puts the real name back. Equal length is the whole safety argument: no
offset, length, or size field in the blob changes, so the edit is a pure byte overwrite that
tweakcc's own repack reads back as an ordinary module name.

- **The shim must never survive into a published binary.** Claude Code's other modules
  (`image-processor.node`, `audio-capture.node`, …) live at `/$bunfs/root/*` and resolve against the
  entry module's own directory, so shipping the stand-in name would break them. It is applied twice —
  around `readContent`, and again around `writeContent`, which re-parses the candidate — and undone
  after each.
- **`restoreEntryModuleName`'s `resign` flag is load-bearing, and `false` is not the safe default.**
  Re-signing is *required* after a repack, because the write invalidates the ad-hoc signature and an
  unsigned Mach-O will not run. It is *forbidden* on the read path, because `codesign` replaces
  Claude Code's own signature: the seeded candidate stops being byte-identical to the install it came
  from, and the bootstrap path publishes exactly those bytes as the content-addressed pristine
  backup. In development this produced a backup whose content hash did not match the hash in its
  own name; it never shipped, and only an end-to-end run caught it, because a synthetic non-Mach-O
  fixture never reaches `codesign`. The candidate is now re-hashed against `plan.pristineSha256`
  immediately before it is published as a backup, so drifted bytes fail loudly instead.
- **Only rename when tweakcc would otherwise find nothing.** If any module name already matches, the
  shim is a no-op — a second match could hand tweakcc a different module than it picks today, and
  every release before 2.1.229 must keep behaving exactly as it did. This is also what makes the
  two selectors agree: tweakcc *reads* the first name-matching module but *rewrites every* one,
  while the shim renames the entry module specifically. Refusing to fire when a match already
  exists guarantees exactly one match, so all three always mean the same module.
- Locating the name parses the Bun blob directly (scan back from EOF for the trailer, recover the
  blob start from its own `byteCount`) rather than the executable container, so it needs no
  `node-lief`. **Verified on Mach-O only** — ELF and PE are inferred from tweakcc's own reader.
  Every derived offset is bounds-checked and every name must be printable and NUL-terminated: a
  misparse returns null — leaving tweakcc's own error — instead of overwriting sixteen bytes at a
  guessed offset.
- **More than one trailer can be in the file, so the scan validates rather than trusting position.**
  Repacking is not size-neutral (an identity repack of 2.1.231 on Mach-O *shrinks* the blob by 61
  bytes; ELF relocates instead, see below) and
  the replacement section content is written over the old, so the previous blob's trailer survives at
  a **higher** offset. Real binaries also carry a decoy `---- Bun! ----` around 55 MB — Bun's runtime
  ships the literal in `__TEXT`. Candidates are therefore tried from EOF backwards and the first one
  that validates wins. `TAIL_SCAN_BYTES` is a cost bound with a hard floor: the last trailer sits
  683–802 KB from EOF on real binaries, and a window below that silently disables the shim.
- **Restoration is swept, not assumed.** Locating the blob is a search, so "I wrote the name where I
  found the marker" is weaker than it sounds — it is also true of a write into a stale copy while the
  live blob stays shimmed. So after the parse-directed write the whole file is scanned and the real
  name goes back over **every remaining copy that is a module name**, then a second scan proves none
  is left. That is what holds the never-publish-the-stand-in rule up, and it does not depend on the
  parse having picked the live blob: the stale-copy case gets the real name too.
  Read that rule precisely: it is *never publish a binary that resolves its entry module to the
  stand-in*, not *never let those sixteen bytes appear anywhere*. Inert copies may legitimately
  remain — a local patch is allowed to contain the literal — and they are harmless because Bun's
  parser only accepts a NUL-terminated name.
  Refusing to publish on any surviving copy — the earlier behaviour — could not distinguish that
  case from a benign one, and **every ELF build produces the benign one on every patch**. tweakcc
  branches on container format, and only the ELF-with-a-`.bun`-section path *relocates* the section
  to `align(nextVirtualAddress())` and repoints `BUN_COMPILED`; the original bytes are stranded
  rather than overwritten, so the previous module table survives with one orphan copy of the
  stand-in at its original offset, below the relocated blob, while the live table is correct.
  Mach-O and PE assign in place and leave none. That refusal made every Linux install — x64 and
  arm64, glibc and musl — unpatchable from clodex 2.5.2 on, for every Claude Code release since
  2.1.229; macOS and Windows were never affected.
  Relocation is also why an ELF candidate is ~2.4x the pristine binary (324 MB → 770 MB on
  linux-x64 2.1.233; measured again on 2.1.246, 248 MB → 435 MB, ~1.75x now that the blob is a
  smaller share of the file), with roughly 2 GB live while candidate, backup and tweakcc's temp
  coexist — plus, since the write stopped rebuilding the blob, one more copy of the blob's data
  region held in memory across the repack (~164 MB on 2.1.246, ~290 MB on a pre-split release).
  That predates the shim — 2.1.228, which needs no shim at all, balloons identically — and it does
  not compound, because the candidate is reseeded from pristine bytes on every run. Do not add a
  size sanity bound: any plausible cap would recreate the refusal this replaced. Note that the
  candidate is renamed into place, so on ELF this ratio is what the USER ends up with — the "+7.5 MB
  of appended sources" figure above is a Mach-O and PE number, and on ELF that growth rides on top
  of the relocation rather than replacing it.
  Rewriting is sound only while every rewritten copy is one the shim wrote, so `isModuleNameAt`
  requires a trailing NUL and `shimEntryModuleName` declines a binary whose blob already carries a
  marker *as a module name*. Without that test the sweep reached content the guard could never have
  seen, because a local patch's output only lands in the file at `writeContent`, long after the
  guard ran — a patch emitting the stand-in literal had it rewritten to the real name in the
  published binary while `clodex patch` reported success. Both halves need the same predicate:
  narrowing only the sweep would leave the literal in place and then trip the guard on the next run,
  making the binary unreadable.
  **The NUL test narrows this case; it does not eliminate it.** Bun NUL-terminates every string
  field in the blob, not only module names, so a local patch that emits the stand-in immediately
  before a NUL is still rewritten — reproduced against a real repack. Proving an occurrence is a
  module name means parsing the stale table it belongs to, which is not worth adding to a module
  that disappears entirely once tweakcc recognizes `/cli` and the rename goes away. Deleting the
  shim closes this by construction; until then it is a known, opt-in-only limitation — tracked in
  issue #129, which also records the one behaviour the deletion must not silently drop.
- `scripts/extract-cc-bundles.mjs` needs the same shim to read a 2.1.229-or-later bundle. It shims a
  **scratch copy**; the `.orig` backups are the only pristine bytes on the machine and nothing may write to
  them.
- **`scripts/probe-patch-mechanism.mjs` is how you check this on a platform you are not running.**
  The refusal above shipped because every check we had ran on Mach-O, where the ELF behaviour it
  turned on cannot occur. The probe drives the same shim → `readContent` → repack → restore cycle
  `applyPatches` runs, against a Claude Code build for any platform, **without executing it** — so
  a linux-arm64 or win32-x64 binary can be checked from macOS, and it calls the exported functions
  rather than a copy so it cannot drift.

  ```bash
  node scripts/probe-patch-mechanism.mjs <claude-binary> --label linux-x64 --expect-version 2.1.233
  ```

  It checks that the binary parses, that the seeded candidate is byte-identical to the release
  (what the content-addressed pristine backup depends on), that the restore leaves no stand-in
  behind, that a repacked Mach-O still verifies under `codesign`, and that the published bytes read
  back carrying what was written.

  **It also applies every patch site to that build's own bundle** (`scripts/probe-patch-sites.mjs`,
  which calls the real `applyClodexPatches` with a synthetic config that activates all of them), and
  checks that the exact Claude Code compaction markers used by the runtime text-only guard still
  occur in that platform's extracted JavaScript. Both consumers import the same marker module. The
  hourly canary runs this probe against every downloaded platform build before any stronger host or
  container execution check. The probe fails on a missing marker or any `FAIL`, `SKIP`, missing or
  duplicated patch site, and publishes **what the transforms produced** rather than the pristine
  bytes — so the byte-for-byte readback also proves clodex's own emitted patch survives the
  PE/ELF/Mach-O round trip. Read that precisely: since the write stopped rebuilding the blob, the
  patched bytes never enter tweakcc's repack, so what the readback proves is that the container
  RESIZE works on this format and that clodex's own publish round-trips. The
  `blob-sized-as-planned` check pins the sizing arithmetic against the real repack. Anchors were
  assumed platform-independent until Claude Code 2.1.238, where `PATCH 5: model picker options`
  matched five builds and missed `linux-arm64`, `linux-arm64-musl` and `win32-arm64`.

  Two things it still cannot tell you: **that the patched binary runs**, and **that an anchor bound
  to the function it was aimed at** rather than a lookalike that also emits valid JavaScript. Only a
  host or containerised `clodex patch` answers the first. `clodex patch` resolves the version by
  executing the binary (`getClaudeVersionForBinary`), which is exactly why a foreign binary can go
  through the probe and not through the real command. A `compact-prompt-markers` failure is not a
  broken patch site. On a complete extraction it means Claude Code changed the prompt wording and
  the text-only guard stopped matching; first confirm the bundle reader still exposes both builders,
  then update `src/claude-code-compact-prompt.ts` from their extracted wording. Presence catches
  removal or in-place rewording of today's strings, not a new builder that leaves both old strings.

  `tests/probe-patch-sites.test.ts` pins the probe's synthetic config and its expected-site list
  against the real transform set — so a new or renamed `PATCH` site reddens `pnpm test` rather than
  failing the hourly canary on every downloaded platform build. Revisit it whenever you bump
  `PATCH_TRANSFORMS_VERSION`.

## Patcher invariants

- **A patch that gates on TIME needs a re-render, and the renderer decides how.** PATCH 11 and
  PATCH 12 together hide the hook banner until its batch is old enough. The obvious shape — read the
  clock in the renderer — does not work, because the function is passed as a selector to a caching
  `useSyncExternalStore` wrapper: `if(o!==null&&o.snapshot===n&&o.select===s)return o.selected`. The
  snapshot changes only on create, settle and dispose, so a clock read is computed at those three
  moments and frozen in between; a hook that blocks for a minute would never start showing. The
  other way to force recomputation — a fresh selector per render — is the one React documents as a
  footgun, because it makes `getSnapshot` non-idempotent. So the second site schedules ONE
  `setState` at the threshold, changing the snapshot's identity exactly once per batch. **Mutating
  the array in place is not a tick**: the memo keys on the object, so an in-place push recomputes
  nothing. The invariant for any future time-based gate is that the tick belongs at the WRITER, not
  at the reader, and it must be a new object.
- **A patch that adds a field to a record must add it to the literal, not to a copy.** PATCH 11 puts
  `startedAt` on the batch record so it survives `settle`, which rebuilds the entry as
  `{...<entry>,settled:…}`. A field attached to the object after construction survives that spread
  too, but a field attached to a copy on the way into the store does not, and the two are
  indistinguishable until a hook actually settles — so the emitted code is EXECUTED in a test that
  settles a hook, rather than asserted as a substring.
- **A postcondition that only the UNPATCHED bytes satisfy makes a re-run refuse its own output.**
  PATCH 11 counts the record literal across the whole bundle as its identity check, and that counter
  runs again when the source already carries the patch this very site wrote. Requiring the pristine
  spelling made a second `clodex patch` reject the binary the first one had just produced, with
  "anchor not found" — the error that reads like Claude Code having moved the site. Any whole-bundle
  discriminator for a site that REWRITES that same text has to accept the patched form too. PATCH 5
  and PATCH 10 sidestep this by counting against `source`, the original, but that only helps a site
  whose counted text is not the text it rewrites.

- **The eight published builds of one Claude Code version are eight different bundles, and a
  minified identifier is not stable across them.** 2.1.238 named the `/model` picker's builder
  `(e,t,r){let n=…}` on five of the eight published builds but `(e,t,n){let r=…}` on linux-arm64,
  linux-arm64-musl and win32-arm64, so PATCH 5's anchor — which spelled `r` out — matched five
  builds and silently dropped every picker entry on the other three. Tie repeated names together
  with back-references instead of spelling them out, and when the replacement has to name a
  variable, capture it from the match rather than assuming the name. **Wildcarding alone is not
  enough**: an anchor made of pure structure (ternary → loop → call) identifies nothing, and a
  review demonstrated a same-shaped neighbour being patched, with status `OK`, once the real site
  drifted out of the match. Keep a semantic discriminator that only the intended site can satisfy —
  for PATCH 5 that is the builder's own `"opus"`/`"sonnet"` comparison — and **count the
  discriminator across the whole bundle, not just the anchor**. "Matched once" means one candidate
  survived, not that it was the right one: a second review built a twin carrying its own
  opus/sonnet selection, moved the real picker out of the match by turning `for(` into `for (`, and
  PATCH 5 injected into the twin and reported success. Because the anchor begins with the counted
  expression, at most one site in the bundle can match it. Read that guarantee precisely — it
  holds **only while the real site keeps spelling the discriminator the way the count spells it**.
  Were
  the picker respelt upstream to the equivalent `(x==="sonnet"||x==="opus")` while something else
  adopted the counted spelling, the survivor would be the wrong function again; if only the
  spelling drifts, the count goes to zero and PATCH 5 fails loud, which is the safe direction.
  Note also that both regexes are **lexical, not syntax-aware**: they match inside block comments
  and template literals (executed — one match each), so "occurs once" is a claim about bytes, not
  about executable code. **An identity oracle must be derived from content, never position** — an
  oracle that took "the function following the built-in option factory" blessed that same twin,
  because the twin was inserted into exactly that gap. Note what the replacement does and does not
  prove: it validates the appender the builder loops through, so a different caller of the genuine
  appender would inherit that evidence; it rejects the realistic impostor, which brings its own.
  Verify with the real-bundle harness over **every downloaded platform's** bundle
  (`scripts/extract-cc-bundles.mjs` reads a foreign binary fine), not just this Mac's. This is why the
  canary now applies the patch sites to every bundle it downloads: before that check existed,
  win32-arm64 recorded a `pass` for the release this broke.
- **An anchor that spells out a statement upstream can delete is a required patch waiting to fail.**
  Claude Code 2.1.239 moved BOTH ends of PATCH 10's child-env builder in a single release — the
  opening `let` gained an optional call and a *destructuring* declarator (`{settingsColorEnv:n}=e`,
  so the declarator run now carries braces), and the GitHub-Actions input scrub the anchor ended on
  (``delete p[`INPUT_${f}`]``) was deleted outright. PATCH 10 is required, so every one of the eight
  published builds refused to patch at all. Neither end was load-bearing for the replacement: what
  the transform needs is the function's opening brace, its body, and its closing brace. Describe
  each end by what the builder MEANS and let back-references tie the repeats:
  * the head runs from `function X(){` + `let`/`let{`/`let[` to a pinned name over `[^;{}]`
    characters **or balanced `{...}` groups**, plus one optional trailing **unclosed** `{…` so the
    pin may sit inside a destructuring pattern — that admits the destructuring and the `??{}` while
    still making it impossible to consume the enclosing function's closing brace, which would need
    an *unmatched closing* one;
  * the tail is `return <copy>}` where `<copy>` is **back-referenced** from the merged copy the
    builder declares (`let <copy>={...process.env,...}`), so it survives a rename of that copy and
    steps over a nested return of some *other* variable. It is rename-resistant, not
    refactor-proof. It does NOT prove the match stopped on
    the function's own brace — the walk below does that.
  Identity is carried by the passthrough early-out — `)return process.env;let <copy>={` —
  counted across the WHOLE bundle before the anchor runs, the same discipline PATCH 5 uses. Over
  29 real bundles (2.1.208 through all eight 2.1.239 builds) it occurs exactly once and exactly one
  head candidate precedes it; on the 21 pre-2.1.239 bundles the widened anchor's matched span is
  **byte-identical** to the one it replaces, which is what shows this is a widening and not a
  rebinding.
  The last line is a postcondition: walk the real block
  from the function's own `{` and require that it ends exactly where the anchor ended. A lazily
  found tail can stop in the wrong place in **either** direction and both are silent without it.
  Short: a nested `return <copy>}` ends the match inside the function, so only part of it is
  rewritten and live `process.env` reads survive. Long: minify the builder's own final
  `return <copy>}` into the comma form `return f(),<copy>}` — 400+ of those already exist
  elsewhere in 2.1.239 — and the tail runs past the true end into a neighbour and rewrites ITS
  `process.env` to a name out of scope there, which throws at runtime. **Do not credit the
  `}<space>function` guard with stopping that**: a neighbour introduced as `};var x=()=>{` never
  matches it. Both shapes were executed against a real 2.1.239 bundle; with the walk they refuse,
  without it they report `OK`.
  **Tally `{` and `}` as characters and you get this backwards in both directions**: a single `"}"`
  in a string refuses a builder that patches fine, and that same string brace offsets the `{` of a
  nested `return <copy>}` so a truncated match reads as balanced. The walk therefore skips strings,
  template literals and comments. It reads `/` as division, never as a regex literal — telling
  those apart needs the grammar. **That is a known limit, not a safe approximation.** A review
  built `…if(x){var re=/}/;return <copy>}…;return <copy>}`, where the unbalanced `}` inside the
  regex literal moves the walk's zero-crossing onto the nested return: the truncated match agrees
  with it and PATCH 10 reports `OK` with a live `process.env` read stranded past the rewritten
  span. Left as-is deliberately, because closing it means parsing JavaScript. **But the reason it
  is unreachable is not the one that used to be written here.** "Zero instances; a regex literal no
  minifier emits" is measurably false: the walk reads `/` as division, so an unescaped `{` or `}`
  inside a regex literal mis-tallies it, and that is ordinary — each 2.1.260 build holds 90 such
  literals, and the walk disagrees with a real parser on 3-4 of the named `function X(){` bodies
  this anchor can open, per bundle, in all 27. A review built a silent wrong
  bind from it (a decoy carrying `/[{]/`, an arrow-function builder carrying `/[}]/`, phantom braces
  cancelling so `bound` lands on 0) that emits a builder reading `_clodexChildEnv` without declaring
  it — every child command would throw. It reproduces on the pre-2.1.260 anchor too, so it belongs
  to the walk, not to any one head. What makes it unreachable is that a mis-tallied function must
  still REACH the passthrough, and in all 27 bundles the builder is immediately preceded by
  `}function ` — a 0-byte window the body run will not cross. Watch that window, not the literal
  count.
  Count the discriminator against the **original source**, not the partly-patched buffer: PATCH 4
  and PATCH 5 splice user-supplied model display text into the bundle, so counting afterwards lets
  a model label that happens to contain the signal refuse a patch that would otherwise succeed.
- **The same lesson again, on the value the head ends at.** Claude Code 2.1.260 left every other anchor
  landmark in the child-env builder intact and rewrote how it asks whether it is running remote: in
  every measured pre-2.1.260 builder that was a call wrapping a `process.env` read whose result fed a ternary
  (`<fn>(process.env.CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE)?`), and 2.1.260 reads the flag off the typed env accessor
  and compares it inline (`i=a.CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE===!0`). (It was not the only change — 2.1.260 also
  added `CLAUDE_CODE_QUESTION_EXTENDED` handling and a remote `BUN_JSC_` scrub, growing the builder
  1942 → 2104 bytes — but it is the change that invalidated the head.) Neither the call nor the
  `process.env.` prefix survives, PATCH 10 is required, and `clodex patch` refused all eight
  published builds — the same failure as 2.1.239, one release after the anchor had already been
  widened once. **A value the builder happens to COMPUTE is only as durable as the expression that
  computes it.** The head now ends at either that ternary or **`getAgentProxyEnv`**, the agent-proxy
  env this builder folds into the child's environment — the thing PATCH 10 exists to correct, rather
  than a flag check that can be rewritten again. `getAgentProxyEnv` is a cross-module property and
  export name and stayed unminified, spelled identically, in all 27 measured bundles; that is an
  observation, not a guarantee, and **rename-proof is not the same as spelled in the builder**.
  Keep BOTH alternatives for exactly that reason: the name is not new — it occurs 6 times in the
  real 2.1.238 bundle, including its own `__export` map entry — but that builder reaches the env
  through a helper, `function JP(){let e=NDt(),…` where `NDt` is
  `return <mod>.getAgentProxyEnv?.()??{}`, so the builder spells it nowhere. Every measured builder
  from 2.1.246 on spells it inline. Dropping the ternary would have refused 2.1.238 (measured on its
  darwin-arm64 build, the only one on disk) and presumably everything older, which is not measured.
  The head run also tolerates the pin sitting inside a destructuring pattern, and an opening `let{`
  or `let[` with no space — 2.1.239 already made that move on the sibling property of the same
  registry entry, a minifier drops the space for a pattern of either kind (4784 `let{` and 2246
  `let[` in each measured Darwin 2.1.260 bundle; the Linux and Windows builds are within a few
  dozen), and a run that can only consume a `{...}` group WHOLE could never
  stop inside one. Measured over
  27 real bundles (2.1.238, 2.1.246, 2.1.252, 2.1.257, 2.1.259 and all eight 2.1.260 builds) the
  head matches exactly once per bundle, as does the whole anchor; on the 19 predating 2.1.260 the
  **whole anchor's** matched span — not the head prefix, which ends earlier on 18 of the 19;
  2.1.238 has no inline `getAgentProxyEnv`, so its head is unchanged — and the whole
  `applyClodexPatches` output are byte-identical to what the old anchor produced. Relaxing to a bare
  `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` instead was measured and rejected: four head candidates on 2.1.238, five on
  each 2.1.246 build, six from 2.1.252 on, leaving identity resting entirely on the passthrough
  count. **A patched builder is not the same claim as a correct one** —
  `.claude/harnesses/cc260-patch10-execute-real-builder` extracts the patched builder from each of
  the eight bundles, checks that their first-occurrence identifier-token skeletons are identical,
  and executes each one; copy it when a release moves the builder again.
- **Calibrate a patch-anchor weakness by corpus reachability and by which direction it fails, not
  by whether an attack can be constructed** — one always can, against every site we ship.
  PATCH 5's surviving hole needs upstream to make two coordinated changes at once (respell its own
  discriminator *and* introduce the counted spelling elsewhere, in a function that also matches the
  full anchor shape); it has zero instances across every bundle we hold, and it was accepted rather
  than defended. The reason is the incident itself: **this outage was caused by an over-specific
  anchor**, and every discriminator added is one more thing a benign upstream rename can break for
  real users. Weigh added specificity against that, prefer anchors that fail loud over anchors that
  fail silent, and let the canary — which now runs the real patch sites on Linux and the host —
  catch the loud ones.
- **The alias IS the model identity in the binary.** For any favorite with an alias, the short name
  (`sol`) — never the canonical `clodex:<provider>:<model>` id — is what lands in the Agent-tool zod
  enum (PATCH 1), the known-alias validator list (PATCH 3), the `/model` picker value (PATCH 5), and
  the context-window map (PATCH 7). Subagent/skill/agent `model:` frontmatter is validated against
  that same enum, so injecting canonical ids made `model: sol` fail with InputValidationError.
  Favorites with no alias fall back to their canonical id as the identity (enum + validator +
  context map only; no resolver case, no picker entry).
- **PATCH 6 (alias resolver switch) maps each alias to ITSELF.** The case must exist — the switch's
  `default:` returns null — but resolving to the canonical id would make Claude Code send one name
  while looking its context window up under another. That is the same mismatch as the response-echo
  bug — the MITM layer resolves short alias names as request model ids and echoes bodies unrewritten,
  so *name in enum == name sent == name echoed == context-map key*. The map keeps the canonical id
  as an extra key so pre-alias lookups still hit.
- **A `/model` picker row (PATCH 5) is titled with the model's own name, not the alias.** The title
  is `formatModelLabel` (`GPT-5.6 Sol`) and the description is `<provider name> · /model <alias>`
  (`OpenAI (ChatGPT) · /model sol`), carried as the entry's `name` and `provider`. Claude Code
  reuses the row title in its own strings — `Effort not supported for <title>` — and a
  `modelPicker` option `label` in `~/.claude/settings.json` does not override it (2.1.273: that
  label reaches the startup banner while the row kept clodex's title). An entry with no `name` —
  a favorite whose model is missing from the registry cache — gets the title-cased alias over
  `Custom model (<id>)`. The Agent tool description (PATCH 4) uses the full label from
  `httpProxyDisplayName()` (`src/http-proxy/routes.ts`), the same string `clodex server` prints at
  startup and `clodex models --list` shows. `modelPickerOption` builds the row for both the
  transform and its built-in proof.
- **Text injected into a string literal must be ASCII.** All 1,790 JavaScript modules of the
  darwin-arm64 2.1.273 build carry the same module encoding byte (`1`), and a raw `·` in the picker
  row rendered as `Â·` in the real picker — its UTF-8 bytes read as Latin-1. `modelPickerOption`
  writes non-ASCII as `\u` escapes, which is also how Claude Code's own bundle spells it (1,789 of
  those 1,790 modules are pure ASCII). PATCH 4 still splices display text raw, so a non-ASCII model
  or provider name should reach the Agent tool description garbled too; that is inferred, not
  observed.
- `buildDesiredPatchConfig()` is disk-only (preferences + registry models cache — no network, no
  credentials).
- `computePatchConfigHash` = sha256 of `[PATCH_TRANSFORMS_VERSION, key-sorted [key, alias??null,
  context??null, display??null, effort-levels??null, default-effort??null, name??null,
  provider??null] array]`, plus the versioned local-module content identity only while local
  patches are enabled. Disabled users
  retain the exact historical hash shape. The manifest at `~/.clodex/patch-state.json` (binary path,
  claude version, config hash, patched size/sha256, backup path, pristine sha256 — the last absent
  in pre-content-addressed manifests) drives `evaluatePatchState` →
  `unpatched | current | stale-config | stale-binary`.
- **PATCH 10 isolates proxy-mode bridge settings from standard child commands.**
  `computeWrapperEnv()` and `buildHttpProxyChildEnv()` write `CLAUDE_CODE_CLODEX_NETWORK_ENV`, a
  versioned compare-before-revert contract holding the external and injected values for the proxy
  variables, bypass lists, and `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. The patched shared child-environment builder
  restores an external value only while the live value still equals what clodex injected, so nested
  wrappers cannot preserve a dead bridge port and settings-level overrides remain authoritative. It
  always removes the contract from the child and requires both contract records to contain the same
  recognized keys with only string or null values. PATCH 10 is deliberately **required**: publishing
  without it would silently reintroduce bridge settings into child commands, while a failed required
  patch leaves the installed binary untouched. **The contract does not cover** endpoint-mode
  `ANTHROPIC_*` variables, the separate `--bg --exec` environment path, or a plain nested `claude`
  launched from Bash — use `clodex-claude` when a nested client must stay bridged.
- **Bump `PATCH_TRANSFORMS_VERSION` in the same commit whenever the transform set changes
  materially** — a site added or removed, or a site's regex, replacement, or ordering changed. That
  hash is the manifest's only record of the transform set; without the version folded in, a user
  whose favorites are unchanged stays `current` forever and silently never receives the new
  transforms. A test pins a sha256 of `patch-transforms.ts` plus `network-env.ts` so the decision is
  forced rather than forgotten; for a comment-only edit, re-pin the digest and leave the version
  alone. **That pin is a tripwire, not a behavioural test** — never let it be the only red test in a
  mutation check (see `.claude/skills/pr-verification/SKILL.md`).
- **Never patch on top of a patch, and never publish a partial patch.** `applyPatch` never writes
  the live binary in place. It builds into a *candidate* inside a sibling temp dir
  (`.clodex-patch-*`, removed in a `finally`) and `renameSync`s it over the binary only after every
  *required* site applied and the repack succeeded (PATCH 4 and 5 are `required:false` and may FAIL
  without blocking) — which is what makes the "required effort patches failed" throw (PATCH
  8a/8b/8c/9) safe: the install is still whole. The candidate is seeded from the *established
  pristine bytes*, not the live binary, whenever the live binary is not itself provably pristine —
  regardless of what the manifest says.
- **Whatever the seed, the bytes about to be patched must carry no clodex patch marker.** The live
  binary is checked on the bootstrap path, and a backup is checked after it is seeded, because
  `verifyPristineSource` only proves the *version* — and a patched claude reports its version
  perfectly well. A poisoned backup is reachable (every clodex before content addressing snapshotted
  whatever was live when no backup existed), and patching one would both double-patch the install
  and launder the result into a content-addressed name that is otherwise trusted on sight. Both
  reachability paths are observed, not hypothetical: pre-content-addressing clodex snapshotted
  whatever was live when no backup existed, **and the version-resolution bug generated exactly that
  state**. That check runs **before** any write to the backup directory, so a poisoned backup can
  neither be adopted nor clobber the `native-binary.backup` mirror. Extraction is expensive (~250 MB), so it
  happens **once**: the candidate is seeded from the live binary and inspected there — a
  byte-identical copy — and the same extraction feeds the patch when the verdict is "unpatched".
  Only unusable bytes pay for a second seed + extract.
- **Local patches are explicitly trusted code and an extension, never a local-only mode.** Only
  `~/.clodex/local-patches.mjs` (respecting `CLODEX_HOME`) is considered, and only after
  `--enable-local-patches` persists the opt-in; there is no cwd, package, dependency, or
  `node_modules` discovery. `inspectLocalPatchSource` captures and hashes the module **without
  executing it**. Execution happens only inside `applyPatch`, after required built-ins succeed,
  against their pristine-seeded output. The set is all-or-none: any load, validation, marker,
  transform, or post-local built-in verification failure discards every local mutation but still
  publishes the complete built-ins. Host-generated `/*clodex-local:<id>*/` markers are distinct from
  the blocking `/*ccpatch:` tier, and local transforms may not alter prior local markers or built-in
  sites. Keep the module deterministic and self-contained — only its entry bytes participate in
  freshness. The `source` a local patch receives is **every JavaScript module joined with
  ``/*clodex:module-boundary`;{}"]*/`` lines**, not one module's text — on every version, not only the
  split ones, because a pre-split blob already carried five helper modules beside the bundle.
  A transform that adds or removes a boundary fails the whole patch loudly. State the rest of the
  guarantee precisely, because it is narrower than it looks: that is a COUNT check, so a local
  transform that MOVES text across a boundary while leaving the separators intact would relocate
  code into another module's scope and nothing would report it. What rules the built-ins out is the
  separator itself, not the count — see `bun-bundle.ts` — and local patches are explicitly trusted
  code that may use any regex at all, so for them this is a documented limit rather than a hole to
  plug. The positional case (append/prepend rather than match) is called out in README, where a
  local-patch author will see it.
- **Patch-marker detection is two-tier** (`patch-backup.ts`). Only the `/*ccpatch:` prefix —
  clodex's own injected text — may *block*, and it covers everything current clodex publishes
  because PATCH 8a/8b/8c/9 are required and each emits one. The weaker legacy signals (PATCH 4's
  description text, PATCH 5's picker dedupe guard, `"clodex:` ids) only *warn*: they can collide
  in principle with Claude Code's own bytes, and a false positive is **unrecoverable** — refusing to
  bootstrap tells the user to reinstall Claude Code, which yields identical bytes and an identical
  refusal. A missed legacy patch is recoverable by comparison. **Proof blocks, heuristic warns.**
  The proof tier has one known narrow gap: a pre-effort-sites clodex emitted `/*ccpatch:ctx*/` only
  when some model had a non-default context window — verified against the real 2.1.220 bundle.
- **Pristine backups are content-addressed:** `~/.tweakcc/claude-<ver>-<sha256 prefix>.orig`, so one
  name can never hold two different contents and every backup self-validates by rehashing. A backup
  becomes the pristine source ONLY when its provenance is established: the version tag must equal
  the version probed from the binary being patched, its hash must match its own name, and a legacy
  `claude-<ver>.orig` (no hash in the name, possibly mislabeled by an older clodex) must
  additionally report that version when executed (`verifyPristineSource`). Conflicting or
  unverifiable backups produce a loud error, never a copy. **A matching version tag is not install
  provenance**: the npm platform package and the native installer ship different files under the same
  Claude Code version, and both are supported, so one machine can hold two same-version installs whose
  bytes differ. The manifest holds **one** install — so it can confirm a backup but can never rule one
  in by elimination (the per-backup sidecar below is what does that). Two states therefore refuse
  outright rather than fall through to version-tag selection (issue #199, reproduced
  on real 2.1.266 binaries in issue #199, and again on real 2.1.263 bytes with a byte-differing
  second copy standing in for the second install; the published 2.1.263 npm and native artifacts are
  independently known to differ in both size and hash):
  - the manifest records a **different** `binaryPath` than the resolved target — it vouches for
    nothing in the backup directory, and the error names the install it does belong to (unless a
    per-backup sidecar records this one; see below);
  - the manifest records **this** target but the pristine bytes it named are gone or corrupt — its own
    testimony says the same-version backups still on disk were made for some other install.

  A manifest speaks only for the `claudeVersion` it was written for. After an upgrade it records a
  backup of the OLD version, which is not among the new version's candidates at all — so neither
  refusal fires across a version change, and a restore that was never in danger is not rejected.

  Disqualifying only the backup the manifest names is NOT sufficient and was rejected during review:
  the manifest holds one install, so every earlier install's backup is an unrecorded orphan carrying
  the same version tag, and "restore the one it did not name" hands a third install's bytes to the
  target — turning a `conflicting pristine backups` refusal into a destructive copy.

  Path identity is plain string equality, so a manifest written under a different spelling of the
  same path reads as another install and refuses — safe, but a false refusal, and it blocks
  `clodex patch` as well as `--restore`. **This is not Windows-only**: APFS is case-insensitive and
  the `fs.realpathSync` clodex uses preserves caller-supplied case (only `.native` corrects it), so a
  hand-typed `TWEAKCC_CC_INSTALLATION_PATH` reaches it on macOS. `evaluatePatchState` compares the
  same way. The message names the recorded path, so following its own
  `TWEAKCC_CC_INSTALLATION_PATH=` advice recovers. This gate covers both consumers —
  `applyPatch` seeds its candidate from those bytes, and **`clodex patch --restore` copies straight
  over the live binary** (nothing to publish atomically), so an unverified backup would be a silent
  downgrade either way. An already-patched binary is never snapshotted as pristine. Legacy backups
  are adopted (copied to their content address) rather than orphaned — and whether the canonical
  name already holds the right bytes is decided from the scan's **content hash, not `existsSync`**,
  so a truncated or foreign file parked there is replaced instead of adopted and published. Every
  write into the backup directory goes through `publishBackupFile` (temp + `rename`), because an
  interrupted ~250 MB `copyFileSync` would leave a truncated file under a name asserting its content
  hash — the one corruption content-addressing cannot notice without re-hashing.
  `~/.tweakcc/native-binary.backup` is still mirrored from the pristine bytes for `tweakcc
  --restore`. That mirror is a SINGLE slot holding whichever install clodex patched last, so on a
  machine with two same-version installs `tweakcc --restore` performs exactly the copy the rules
  above refuse. clodex writes the file but does not control that command.
- **Each backup records which installs it was made for, in one file per install beside it** —
  `claude-<ver>-<sha>.orig.for-<hash of install path>.json`, holding
  `{"install": "<path>", "assumed": <bool>}` (issue #204). The manifest could not carry this: it holds
  **one** install and a successful `--restore` **deletes** it, so a backup routinely outlives the only
  record of what it belonged to. patch A → restore A → have the target resolve to a different
  same-version install B → restore again published A's pristine bytes over B with nothing but a
  warning, and **no files were lost anywhere in that sequence**. (`~/.clodex` wiped or a different
  `CLODEX_HOME` reach the same state.) A user who answered the `conflicting pristine backups` refusal
  by deleting one file could also launder the wrong bytes into a manifest every later restore then
  trusted on sight.

  **One file per install, never a shared list.** A single list would have to be read, merged and
  rewritten, and the patch lock lives under `CLODEX_HOME` while the backup directory is shared — two
  concurrent patches under different `CLODEX_HOME`s would lose an entry. A create-once file per
  install has nothing to merge. Multiple installs is the normal case, not an edge: backups are
  content-addressed, so two installs whose pristine bytes are identical legitimately share one backup
  and it is correct for either. The install path is hashed only to keep the file name safe and
  fixed-length; selection reads the path from inside the file, and a record whose name does not agree
  with the install it holds is treated as damaged rather than trusted.

  Consequences:
  - a backup recorded for some OTHER install is refused, exactly like a manifest that records one;
  - a record naming THIS install outranks a manifest that records a different one — it is direct
    evidence, where the manifest was only evidence about the directory;
  - a two-install machine now **works** instead of refusing: each install's own backup names it, so
    `Found conflicting pristine backups` is no longer the outcome of the ordinary two-install case;
  - restoring one install therefore must NOT clear the manifest belonging to another — `--restore`
    clears the manifest only when it records the install being restored;
  - a manifest that disagrees with an established record for the same install refuses — **but only
    when the manifest does not describe the live bytes**. That state is reachable both ways round:
    one install path rewritten in place with a different build of one claude version (the manifest is
    then stale), or one install legitimately snapshotted twice, which `tweakcc` theming produces and
    the snapshot path keeps both files for on purpose. What separates them is
    `manifest.patchedSha256 === liveSha256`: when it holds, clodex provably wrote those bytes last, so
    the manifest is current and its backup is the right source. Refusing there instead made every
    later patch AND restore of an ordinary single-install machine fail permanently, with a message
    telling the user to reinstall — which does not clear a record. Where neither claim can be dated,
    the refusal stands, and both it and the two-records-disagree refusal now **name the record files**,
    because deleting the stale one is the way out;
  - a record that exists but **cannot be read** refuses rather than falling back to the version tag.
    That includes a record that is unopenable rather than malformed (a directory, a dangling link,
    mode 000): its name came out of the same directory listing, so "absent" is not an available
    reading. Damaged positive evidence is not the same as no evidence — something claimed those
    bytes. The message names the file, and deleting it opts back into the fallback;
  - the version-tag fallback is refused for an install these bytes were **already guessed onto**. The
    first guess proves nothing about ownership, which is why it neither selects nor establishes, but
    running the same fallback again is how one install's bytes reach two. A guess recorded for THIS
    install does not refuse — that is the same decision being repeated, and the single-install machine
    depends on it.

  **ESTABLISHED vs ASSUMED, and what may promote.** A record's `assumed` flag says whether the
  association was proven or matched on a version tag, and the distinction has to survive every path
  that could re-derive it:
  - a guess is recorded AS a guess rather than skipped. Skipping was not enough: after a warned
    version-tag restore the live bytes match the backup *because the guess put them there*, so the
    next patch took the `reuse` path and recorded it as established;
  - the manifest carries `pristineProvenance: 'assumed'` when the run that wrote it guessed, so the
    next run cannot read a guessing run's own manifest as independent proof. Absent is read as
    established, which is not a proof — a manifest written before the field existed may record a run
    that guessed and is indistinguishable from one that did not. It is accepted because those
    manifests are the migration path for every existing install;
  - **every** plan **inherits** the confidence already recorded for those bytes. Confidence belongs to
    the CONTENT, not to a filename: asking only about the name a plan chose left a third name carrying
    the guess — restore B from a legacy backup by version tag, patch A so that backup is adopted under
    its content address, then patch B, which picks the canonical name, finds no record of B beside it,
    and established what the legacy name still called a guess. So every alias holding these exact bytes
    is consulted, and the content address and the legacy name are read directly, because the scan finds
    records only beside an existing `.orig` and a record outlives its backup. `reuse` matches bytes a guess may have put there, and
    canonicalizing a legacy backup would otherwise launder a guess through a filename change. A
    `snapshot` is no exception, even though it inspected the live bytes itself: if a guess restored
    those very bytes onto this install, "the install holds them" is a fact the guess created, and
    establishing on it would hand the bytes' true owner a refusal. **Nothing promotes a guess.** The
    protection a promotion looked like it was buying is already provided by refusing the fallback for
    an install these bytes were guessed onto, and an install whose record stays a guess is not
    stranded — its own restores still work, with the note;
  - an established record is never downgraded. Callers ask for what their run can prove, and a run
    that can prove less must not erase what an earlier one knew.

  **Both migration sites cover a manifest for another VERSION at this same path**, not only one for
  another install: its backup is still on disk and clearing the manifest would leave it unattributed.

  **`--restore` records before it writes, and before it clears.** Before the copy, because the guess
  changes the live bytes to the backup's — after that, "the live bytes match this backup" is no longer
  independent evidence, so the record saying it was a guess must already be on disk. If it cannot be
  written, the guess is **refused** and the binary is untouched: it is the optional compatibility
  path. Before the manifest is cleared, because the manifest may be the only thing attributing that
  backup, and the manifest is dropped **only once an established record stands in its place** — a
  manifest is stronger than a guess, so trading it for one destroys testimony instead of migrating it.
  When the write fails on an established restore, the rescue still happens and the manifest is kept.

  **`clodex patch` migrates the manifest it is about to replace**, when that manifest records a
  different install or a different claude version. The manifest holds one install, so patching a
  second one used to strip the first's only attribution.

  **No pristine backup is published before its record** — not the fresh snapshot, and not the
  canonical name a legacy backup is adopted into. A published `.orig` with no record beside it is
  precisely the unattributed same-version file this exists to prevent, and a crash or a full disk
  between the two writes would leave one for good. The reverse order is safe: a record whose backup
  never appeared is inert, because scanning starts from the `.orig` files, and it stays true if those
  bytes ever land at that address again.

  **What remains is a backup written before records existed**: nothing attributes it, so selection
  falls back to the version tag and the plan carries a loud note saying exactly that. Refusing would
  strand every backup an earlier clodex wrote, including on the single-install machine where the guess
  is always right. It self-heals — `--restore` and `clodex patch` both migrate a manifest's evidence,
  and any patch of that install writes a record. Three narrower gaps stay open and are not closed
  here:
  - **Path identity is still plain string equality** (see below), so a case-only respelling of an
    install path on APFS reads as another install: the restore is refused rather than falling back —
    safe, and the message names the recorded spelling to use — and a manifest for the same install
    under the other spelling survives a restore rather than being cleared. The fix is one
    path-equivalence helper over `realpathSync.native`/inode, which invalidates the `binaryPath` in
    every existing manifest and so needs a migration.
  - **Replacing the executable at the SAME path with a different same-version artifact** leaves a
    record pointing at a path whose bytes are no longer the ones it was written for. Two established
    records now disagree and refuse, and a manifest disagreeing with a record refuses too, so the
    destructive form is narrowed to the case where neither exists yet. Closing it entirely needs
    `--restore` to read the live bundle for a `/*ccpatch:` marker first — issue #204's fix 1 — which
    is Mach-O/ELF/PE-sensitive and needs the per-format probe.
  - **A record's confidence is written with temp + rename, not compare-and-swap.** Two processes
    recording the SAME install under different `CLODEX_HOME`s can race, and the last rename wins, so
    an established record can be replaced by a guess. It needs a lock keyed by the backup directory
    rather than by `CLODEX_HOME`; the same missing lock already lets `--restore` (which takes no lock
    at all) interleave with a patch on `main`.

  Two smaller consequences are accepted rather than fixed, both safe directions:
  - an install whose only claim on a backup is a GUESS is refused when another install holds an
    established record for those bytes, even though repeating its own guess used to work. The evidence
    genuinely favours the other install; the message names it, and reinstalling clears it.
  - the migration before a manifest is replaced checks `existsSync(manifest.backupPath)`, so a backup
    that was manually MOVED to another same-version alias is not migrated to its new name. Finding the
    bytes by hash instead would mean re-hashing every same-version backup (~250 MB each) on the
    ordinary two-install patch, which is not worth it for a state only manual file movement reaches.

- **`clodex patch --restore` must work on a binary that no longer runs** — that is what a pristine
  backup is *for*. It resolves the version from `claude --version` when it can, and otherwise falls
  back to the manifest's `claudeVersion` when `manifest.binaryPath` matches the resolved install and
  the live bytes could still be what clodex last wrote, establishing provenance without executing
  anything. An npm placeholder is the exception: it proves a package manager replaced the target, so
  the old manifest is no longer authoritative for that path even though the wrapper's `package.json`
  still reveals its version. The placeholder refusal preserves both manifest and backups. Generic
  broken binaries retain manifest recovery. A successful restore drops the manifest **only when it
  records the install that was restored**: selection can now succeed on a per-backup sidecar while the
  manifest still holds a different install, and clearing it there would delete that install's only
  rescue record. The patch
  path keeps the hard `version-unknown` failure (patching is elective; restoring is the way out), and
  its error message names `--restore` as the recovery.
- **`CLODEX_CLAUDE_PATH` does not choose the patch target, and that is deliberate.** It selects the
  claude that gets LAUNCHED; the patch target override is `TWEAKCC_CC_INSTALLATION_PATH`. Honouring
  the launch override here would hand the patcher a wrapper shim whenever a user points it at one
  for launching — `resolveThroughNpmShims` follows npm launchers, not arbitrary wrappers — which is
  issue #193's "Unable to detect installation type", with the shim's older version then selecting
  the wrong pristine backup. A committed end-to-end test pins that (`patches the resolved install
  and never downgrades it to a PATH shim's version`), so an attempt to "fix" the precedence turns
  red rather than shipping. Issue #217 asked for the precedence to change; what it was right about is
  that the behaviour was undocumented and that the refusal advice named the variable that cannot
  work. `clodex patch` now warns when a `CLODEX_CLAUDE_PATH` is set and something else decided the
  target, and a `TWEAKCC_CC_INSTALLATION_PATH` naming a file that is gone is refused by name rather
  than falling through to another install.

- **Binary resolution bypasses PATH shims** (cmux installs a shim copy):
  `TWEAKCC_CC_INSTALLATION_PATH` → `~/.local/bin/claude` → `findClaudeBinary()`.
  **`~/.local/bin/claude.exe`, which the Windows native installer writes, is deliberately NOT
  probed.** Adding it as a last-resort fallback made an existing restore weakness reachable:
  `findClaudeBinary()` returns the same null for "`CLODEX_CLAUDE_PATH` names a file that is gone" as
  for "nothing found", so a stale explicit override silently became a DIFFERENT install, and
  `--restore` copied the missing install's pristine bytes over it and deleted the manifest —
  reproduced on real 2.1.266 binaries, with the fallback deletion as the control. The manifest half of that
  weakness is fixed (see the provenance rule above), so the fallback can land — as its own change
  carrying its own Windows evidence, not folded into the fix that unblocked it, and only once the
  no-manifest case above is covered too. **The version is
  probed from that resolved binary** (`getClaudeVersionForBinary`), never from
  `getInstalledClaudeVersion()`, whose PATH lookup can land on a different install and whose
  `'2.1.183'` fallback is only safe for request metadata. The version names the backup that gets
  restored, so borrowing it from a shim silently downgraded the user's Claude Code.
  **An unprobeable binary is a hard error on the patch path** — patching is elective, so it refuses
  rather than guessing. `resolveClaudeBinaryForPatch` returns `binary-not-found`,
  `version-unknown`, `native-binary-missing` or `launcher-unresolved`; the launch-time
  check stays non-fatal for every reason (it prints one dim line for failures other than
  `binary-not-found`).
- **An npm placeholder is diagnosed before the version probe** (`claude-native-placeholder.ts`).
  `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` publishes `bin/claude.exe` as a 500-byte text file which its
  postinstall replaces with the platform-native binary. Skipped install scripts or omitted optional
  dependencies leave that text in place, and executing it on Windows reports an invalid application
  while the patcher otherwise collapses it into `version-unknown`. Detection reads content only
  below a 64 KiB size ceiling and requires two independent signals from the shipped text; a real
  binary is rejected by metadata without being read. Seven sampled native releases from 2.1.113
  through 2.1.266 carry all three signals in byte-identical placeholders. Two-of-three is defensive
  against a hypothetical future rewording, not a response to observed drift.

  The detector derives the platform key with the same Android, musl and Rosetta rules as
  Anthropic's `install.cjs`, then resolves that platform package from the wrapper package. When it
  is present, `native-binary-missing` gives the absolute installer path. When it is absent,
  `install.cjs` cannot download it, so the message recommends only a reinstall without the npm
  omission flags. An unknown package layout names both options. Restore also names `--restore` as
  the retry and the pristine-backup directory.

  Patch and restore both refuse before any backup or candidate write, even when an old manifest
  matches the path: the placeholder proves clodex was not the last writer, so the manifest fallback
  is no longer authoritative. Generic unprobeable binaries retain manifest-based recovery.
  Launch-time checking reports the incomplete install without blocking launch.
- **An npm launcher is followed to the program it starts, on the patch path only** (`npm-shim.ts`).
  **This is a Windows install shape**: npm's `bin-links` writes a symlink for a package bin on
  POSIX and only calls `cmd-shim` on Windows, where it writes three launchers per bin —
  extensionless `sh`, `.cmd`, `.ps1` — each naming its program relative to its OWN directory. The
  parsing is platform-independent (which is what makes it testable off Windows), but the install
  shape is not. `findBinaryOnPath` prefers `claude.cmd` on Windows **on purpose**, because
  launching claude there needs a shell script, and `realpathSync` cannot see through a launcher
  (there is no symlink), so the file is parsed with a port of npm's `read-cmd-shim` grammar. Both
  bin shapes Claude Code has shipped must keep working: a native `bin/claude.exe`, which the
  launcher runs directly, and a legacy `cli.js`, which it hands to a nearby node — the program
  named LAST, before the argument forwarder, is the one to patch. `cmd-shim` 9 renamed the sh
  launcher's base directory to `$basedir_win` for the legacy shape; both spellings are read.
  A `cli.js` target is versioned by running it with clodex's own `process.execPath`, because it is
  not an executable on Windows and need not carry the executable bit anywhere. **Do not move this
  into `findClaudeBinary()`** — launch needs the launcher; only the patcher needs the program.
  **Two rules read-cmd-shim does not have**, because clodex uses the answer to pick a file to
  OVERWRITE rather than to report on a link: whole-line comments (`REM`, `::`, `#`) are skipped (the
  grammar runs per line, so it also cannot stitch a target across two of them), and a launcher whose
  remaining lines name two DIFFERENT programs is refused instead of resolved to whichever came
  first — a review reproduced `clodex patch` reporting success against an install the shell never
  starts. Repetition is normal (the real PowerShell launcher names one target four times);
  disagreement is not. **Neither rule is shell analysis.** A line a shell would never reach — a dead
  `if` branch, a heredoc body, a trailing inline comment — is still a candidate; the outcome there
  is the refusal, not a wrong guess, and closing it properly would mean parsing three shells.
  Resolution failure (a launcher whose program is gone, a `.cmd`/`.ps1` whose program cannot be
  read, two programs named) is a refusal *before* any candidate, backup or manifest write, naming
  `TWEAKCC_CC_INSTALLATION_PATH` as the way out — never a fallback to patching the launcher, which is what
  produced issue #193's
  "Unable to detect installation type from path ...\\.clodex-patch-XXXX\\claude.cmd". When the
  program's path could be read but the file is gone, that path is what the failure carries, so a
  manifest recorded against it still matches and `--restore` still works. That is a rescue path
  with a dedicated end-to-end test; a mutation to the launcher path left the whole suite green.
- Concurrency lock `~/.clodex/patch.lock` (pid + 10-min staleness + ESRCH liveness); the loser skips
  with a notice — never blocks, corrupts, or double-patches.
- `runLaunchPatchCheck()` in `clodex claude`: interactive y/N offer when stale; non-TTY or
  `--dry-run` prints a one-line stderr notice and proceeds. It may read/hash an enabled local module
  for freshness but must never execute it unless the user accepts. Wrapped in try/catch — a
  patch-check failure must never break launch.
- Context is omitted from the patch map when unknown or equal to Claude Code's 200k default;
  `[1m]`-suffixed model ids and explicit context are mutually exclusive in the transforms.
- **The per-site transforms in `patch-transforms.ts` (regexes, replacements, ordering, SKIP/FAIL
  semantics) are hard-won — change them only with byte-for-byte equivalence evidence on a real
  binary.** "Applied once, emitted one marker" **cannot** distinguish a correct match from a
  catastrophic over-match; both produce exactly those numbers. Assert the **matched span** and the
  **enclosing function of every rewritten reference**, run the real `applyClodexPatches` over every
  extracted bundle, and execute the emitted patch — reading it is not evidence that it runs.
