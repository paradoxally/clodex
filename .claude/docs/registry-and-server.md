# Provider registry and the gateway server

<!-- Read when changing src/registry/, src/server/, provider templates, or model/alias resolution. -->

## Provider registry

`src/registry/`. The shipped registry has three provider templates in `src/provider-templates.ts`:
`openai` (API key), `openai-oauth`, and `opencode-go`. `provider-auth.ts` implements the OpenAI
OAuth sign-in (device code by default; browser PKCE via `--browser` for workspaces that disable
device codes). Interactive entry points that don't take flags — the providers hub's auth and
add-account actions, the provider detail menu, `providers add`'s OAuth path, and the first-run
wizard — ask instead through `promptOAuthMethod` (`providers-command.ts`), a device-code/browser
picker whose Enter default is device code; the chosen method is forwarded to
`authenticateProvider`. `refresh-models.ts` fetches the model list (3-tier fetch for OAuth).
Materialization (`materialize.ts`) turns registry providers into `LocalProvider`s with per-model
`npm`/`baseUrl`/`upstreamModelId`.

Provider templates can declare reusable controls for non-default behavior:

- **`verifyCredential`** runs an optional template-owned probe before a credential is persisted. It
  receives only the key: a caller-provided base URL must never redirect a live credential.
- **`staticModelPolicy` / `preserveModelPricing`** let a template restrict live discovery to its
  committed allowlist and retain provider-supplied prices. Read pricing preservation through
  `providerPreservesModelPricing()`, which falls back to the template when persisted state predates
  the flag.

`ModelRuntimeCompatibility` (`src/model-runtime-compatibility.ts`) holds provider-neutral per-model
wire quirks consumed by runtime adapters, including reasoning/request-shape controls and whether an
Anthropic-format upstream supports token counting. An explicit `supportsCountTokens: false` selects
clodex's local estimate; an unset value preserves forwarding for custom compatible endpoints.

Registry writes use atomic hard-link lock publication, so the filesystem containing `CLODEX_HOME`
must support hard links. **A parseable lock owned by a live PID is never reclaimed based on age;**
contenders wait a bounded interval and fail with the owner PID. Malformed locks and locks owned by
dead PIDs remain reclaimable. This live-owner rule is what makes the final ownership check before
`providers.json` publication meaningful — a concurrent process cannot invalidate a live writer
between its check and its rename.

**Named OAuth account slots:** `clodex providers auth openai --account <name>` stores an additional
ChatGPT account under a named slot with its own credential-store lineage; the default sign-in is
untouched. `CLODEX_OAUTH_ACCOUNT=<name>` selects a slot at launch — the swap happens once at
registry materialization (`applySelectedOAuthAccount`), so credential resolution, OAuth metadata,
and refresh-token rotation transparently use the selected account, and the WebSocket cache partition
(keyed on the token's account id) stays per-account. Naming a missing slot on a provider that has
slots is a hard error, never a silent fallback to the default identity. Removing the provider queues
every slot credential for deletion.

## Server

`src/server/`: `index.ts` loads models from the registry (`loadServerModels`); `router.ts` handles
`/anthropic` (passthrough for `modelFormat:'anthropic'` with `baseUrl`, SDK adapter for `'openai'`)
and `/openai/v1` (via `src/openai-adapter.ts`). Wizard/quick-start settings persist to config;
network mode requires a password; default port 17645 (`--port` overrides).

A successful OpenCode Go Messages response carries the account's real Go usage as Claude Code's
`anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` headers (`src/opencode-go-usage.ts`), fetched in the background from
`/zen/go/v1/usage` and cached per key, with clodex's synthetic set winning over the upstream's own
on that route. clodex synthesizes nothing on other routes, and the relay forwards an upstream's
own `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-*` headers on success, so a Claude route keeps Claude's numbers.
`CLODEX_TEST_OPENCODE_GO_USAGE` stages a reading for testing.

The one exception is a session whose selected model is a Go model. Claude Code's quota manager has one
reading per process and no model identity, and Claude Code's own background calls are Anthropic
passthrough traffic, so those responses would hand it the Claude plan's numbers while Go is in use.
`src/http-proxy/server.ts` tracks the selected model per `x-claude-code-session-id`
(`src/opencode-go-session.ts`) and, on that passthrough path only, replaces the Claude readings with
Go's own (`src/anthropic-quota-header-filter.ts`). Go's translated replies are unchanged, and every
other session is untouched.

Every inference and count_tokens request builds a client-disconnect controller (`watchClientDisconnect`
in `src/http-utils.ts`, shared with `src/proxy.ts`) and passes its signal to the upstream call — the
raw relays' `fetch`, and the SDK adapters' `abortSignal`. The controller is aborted at end of life on
every path, so consumer abort listeners run at a deterministic point rather than at the garbage
collector's convenience; the abort reason says which path it was. A response `close` before the
response finished writing is a real disconnect (mid-stream as well as before any output) and aborts
with `Client disconnected`; a response that finished writing aborts with `ResponseCompleted` after its
last byte. Ask `clientDisconnected(signal)`, never `signal.aborted`, when deciding whether an error is
worth reporting — a cancelled request writes no error response, because the client that would read it
is the one that left, while non-abort failures still answer the client.

Endpoint-mode request model resolution (`createGatewayModelCatalog` in `server/models.ts`) accepts,
in precedence order: exact catalog id (and its gateway-discovery id) → unmasked gateway id when
`--mask-gateway-ids` is on (`vendor-mask.ts`) → canonical `clodex:{provider}:{model}` id → saved
short aliases from `clodex models --alias` — **the same alias table the proxy-mode MITM resolves**,
so endpoint and proxy routing must never evolve separate alias semantics → 400. Saved alias names
are canonicalized to lowercase, and **requests must use that stored spelling**: resolution is an
exact `Map.get`, so a wrong-case endpoint alias does not resolve.
Invalid, reserved, conflicting, unavailable, or catalog-colliding aliases remain preserved in config
but are reported and kept out of routing. **Aliases and canonical ids are accepted INPUT only** —
`/models` listings advertise exactly the canonical/masked ids. **Echo invariant:** an aliased
request's response `model` field echoes the alias verbatim (even under masking), so the id a client
sees back is the one it sent (`aliasNames` in `ServerOptions`). Note the window lookup itself does
not read the response body — see `.claude/docs/claude-code-internals.md`.
