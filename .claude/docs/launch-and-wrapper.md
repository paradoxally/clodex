# Launch, bridge modes, and the clodex-claude wrapper

<!-- Read when changing src/launch.ts, src/env.ts, src/proxy.ts, src/http-proxy/,
     src/server-runtime.ts, src/claude-wrapper.ts, src/parent-notice.ts, or src/outbound-proxy.ts. -->

## Two bridge modes

Both `clodex claude` and `clodex server` support:

- **endpoint** — local Anthropic-format gateway (`src/proxy.ts` for the claude launch path,
  `src/server/` for the standalone gateway); the child gets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` via
  `buildChildEnv()` (`src/env.ts`). With favorites, `startProxyCatalog()` serves a multi-route
  catalog and Claude Code's `/model` menu lists starting model + favorites.
- **proxy** — selective MITM of `api.anthropic.com` (`src/http-proxy/`): Claude Code keeps its
  normal Anthropic auth; request model ids matching `clodex:{provider}:{model}`
  (`HTTP_PROXY_MODEL_PREFIX` in `src/http-proxy/routes.ts`) or saved aliases
  (`src/model-aliases.ts`) route to OpenAI; everything else passes through untouched.

**Defaults:** `resolveBridgeMode(command, explicit, {persist})` in `src/config.ts` —
`claudeBridgeMode`/`serverBridgeMode` prefs. An explicit `--endpoint`/`--proxy` applies to that run
only and is **never auto-persisted**; persisting requires `--save-mode` alongside a mode flag
(`--save-mode` alone is an arg-parse error). With no flag and nothing saved, both commands default
to **proxy** (works with existing Claude auth; non-TTY gets the same default without prompting).
`--dry-run` never persists. `--proxy` is the only spelling; the former `--http-proxy` alias is gone.

## Server discovery and the `clodex-claude` wrapper

`src/server-runtime.ts`, `src/wrapper-env.ts`, `src/claude-wrapper.ts`.

`clodex server` (both modes) registers itself in `~/.clodex/server-runtime.json` — an **array** of
`{mode, port, pid, caPath (proxy only), startedAt}` records keyed by pid, so a proxy server and an
endpoint server can be advertised simultaneously. Each server removes only its own record on
SIGINT/SIGTERM. The legacy single-object file shape is tolerated on read, wrapped as a one-element
list.

- Read-modify-write is serialized by `~/.clodex/server-runtime.lock`, deliberately the **same pid +
  staleness + ESRCH-liveness pattern as the patcher's `patch.lock`** (10s staleness); after a bounded wait a writer proceeds lockless rather than losing its
  registration. The file is replaced atomically (temp + rename).
- **Stale detection is the reader's job:** readers reject malformed records and dead pids
  (`kill(pid,0)`, EPERM counts as alive); writers additionally prune dead pids under the lock.
- `clodex server --no-discovery` (or `CLODEX_NO_DISCOVERY=1`) opts a server out entirely — e.g. an
  endpoint server used only as a local OpenAI-compatible API that must never co-opt wrapper
  discovery. The per-session MITM spawned by `clodex claude --proxy` never registers either.
- Registration happens after `listenTcpServer` confirms reachability, so a loopback refusal needs no
  retry.

`clodex-claude` (`dist/claude-wrapper.js`) serves both the `CLAUDE_CODE_PROCESS_WRAPPER` contract
(executable first arg = claude binary path, remaining args passed through) and direct terminal use
(binary discovered the same way `clodex claude` discovers it, honoring `CLODEX_CLAUDE_PATH`). `orderWrapperServerCandidates`
prefers **proxy mode over endpoint** (bridging keeps Claude Code's own Anthropic auth), newest
`startedAt` breaking ties. One concurrent TCP probe round covers every candidate; the
highest-priority responder wins. When none answers, only timed-out probes retry under one shared
500ms deadline — definitive connection errors fail immediately.

The wrapper then launches claude with one of three environments (`src/wrapper-env.ts`), and the
branches are asymmetric:

- **proxy-mode server** — sets the proxy variables to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`, deletes
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, sets `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` when the record carries a CA path, and removes
  the Anthropic proxy bypass.
- **endpoint-mode server** — deletes the proxy variables and sets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to
  `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/anthropic` plus the local gateway API key.
- **no live server** — an untouched env: **a down server must never break launching claude.**

Env computation is the pure `computeWrapperEnv`.

**The wrapper must `exec` into claude (`process.execve`), never spawn it as a child.** Claude Code
starts each background pty host with `detached: true`, then delivers resizes to that process group
via `process.kill(-process.pid, 'SIGWINCH')`. A wrapper that parents claude keeps the group-leader
role,
claude's pid stops matching its group id, and the signal dies as ESRCH inside a silent catch —
background sessions freeze at their startup size. Interactive sessions hide this entirely, because
there the kernel delivers SIGWINCH through the controlling terminal. `execve` is POSIX-only and
needs Node 22.15, so Windows and older 22.x keep a spawn fallback; it **aborts the process on
syscall failure instead of throwing**, which is why the binary is re-checked immediately before the
call rather than relied on to fall back. Any shell launcher in front of the wrapper must `exec` too.

**Keep the wrapper tiny and its imports minimal** — it runs for every spawned agent process. Setup
doc: `docs/background-agents.md` (shipped via the `docs` entry in package.json `files`).


## Config and env isolation

`src/paths.ts`, `src/config.ts`, `src/env.ts`:

- Config home `~/.clodex`, override `CLODEX_HOME`. Keychain service `clodex` supports chunked
  entries for Windows credential size limits.
- Preferences: `lastModel`, `lastProvider`, `recentModelsByProvider`, `favoriteModels`,
  `modelAliases`, `claudeBridgeMode`, `serverBridgeMode`, `appPathOverrides`, `localPatchesEnabled`,
  `recentLaunchFolders`, `server*`. All writes skipped when `dryRun`.
- `CLODEX_CLAUDE_PATH` overrides Claude Code binary discovery (`src/claude-binary.ts`, re-exported
  by `src/launch.ts`; the wrapper imports it directly so `launchClaude` stays out of its chunk).
- `buildChildEnv()` copies `process.env`, deletes conflicting `ANTHROPIC_*`/related vars, and sets
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_MODEL` **for the child only**. Claude Code may
  persist the model to `~/.claude/settings.json` itself; that is outside clodex's control (reset
  with `claude --model sonnet`).
- `CLODEX_TEST_OPENCODE_GO_USAGE` overrides the OpenCode Go usage reading with an inlined
  `/zen/go/v1/usage` payload, so a live Claude Code run shows a chosen Go percentage. Server-local
  and server-only: it is never forwarded upstream, and it is the only way to stage a high Go reading
  without a real allowance (`src/opencode-go-usage.ts`).
- `CLODEX_UPSTREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` and `CLODEX_UPSTREAM_TOTAL_TIMEOUT_MS` are resolved by the
  process serving provider requests. `clodex claude` owns that server in-process. With a standalone
  `clodex server`, restart that server with the variables set; putting them only on a
  `clodex-claude` wrapper cannot reconfigure it. Request-time notices are immediate on standalone
  server stderr, while `clodex claude` queues them as described below.

## Parent diagnostics while Claude Code runs

`src/parent-notice.ts`. `launchClaude` mutes `process.stdout/stderr.write` for the child's whole
lifetime because the child inherits the terminal — but clodex's gateway runs in the same process and
produces the warnings documented above. Those sites call `emitParentNotice`, an **opt-in, enumerable
channel**; there is no prefix rule, since a prefix would silently enrol future writers.

Notices are **queued, not painted.** Parent and child share one PTY with no render lock, so a live
write lands mid-frame or on the prompt where it reads as typed input — both observed against real
Claude Code. Sanitizing the message cannot make a live write safe. The queue (bounded, overflow
counted) is flushed in `restore()` once the child has exited, with a synchronous `process.on('exit')`
backstop; the `--debug-file` `[parent] ...` copy stays immediate.

Every terminal write is guarded against an **asynchronous EPIPE** — a closed pipe
(`clodex claude 2>&1 | head -n 1`) reports through the stream's `error` event *after* `write()`
returns, so a synchronous try/catch cannot contain it, and an unhandled one would kill the gateway
out from under a running child.

## Outbound proxy

`src/outbound-proxy.ts`. `installOutboundDispatcher()` (called at the top of `main()`) always
installs the package undici dispatcher globally with HTTP/2 disabled. It uses `EnvHttpProxyAgent`
when `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` are configured, so every fetch-based call (OAuth device flow/refresh,
model-list and models.dev refresh, AI-SDK upstream calls) honors those variables and `NO_PROXY`;
otherwise it uses a direct `Agent`. Pinning fetch to HTTP/1.1 prevents Node 26's bundled undici 8
from retaining a destroyed pooled HTTP/2 session and failing every later request to that origin.

Transports that do not use the undici dispatcher share the same resolver: the `ws`-based OAuth
Responses WebSocket gets an `https-proxy-agent` CONNECT tunnel via `outboundWsProxyAgent()`, and the
raw first-party passthrough creates one keep-alive `outboundHttpProxyAgent()` synchronously after
the local bridge binds and reuses it. If the resolved proxy URL names that same listener — by exact
address, loopback alias, or a local interface behind a wildcard bind — raw passthrough warns and
connects directly rather than recursively tunnelling through itself. Malformed proxy URLs also warn
and fall back to direct connections.

Claude Code's own `NO_PROXY` matcher has two behaviors worth knowing before changing this area:
`no_proxy || NO_PROXY` means **lowercase wins outright — do not union the casings**, and `*` is
bypass-all **only as the entire value** (a list-member `*` matches nothing).

## WebSocket upgrade forwarding in proxy mode

WebSocket upgrade requests inside intercepted `api.anthropic.com:443` connections use
`forwardAnthropicUpgrade` (`src/http-proxy/server.ts`). It connects to the fixed Anthropic
origin with the ordinary passthrough agent and TLS settings, preserves the upgrade status and
headers from the upstream response, forwards any buffered head bytes, and pipes the sockets in
both directions. Upstream HTTP rejections remain HTTP responses with correct chunk framing. Client
disconnects and proxy shutdown cancel the upstream request and socket. This path does not
translate models or inspect audio. Voice workloads use it to stream over persistent WebSocket
connections.
