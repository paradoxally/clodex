/**
 * Every other effort assertion in this suite compares clodex's returned object to a
 * literal copy of what clodex builds — so a wrong option KEY, or the AI SDK renaming
 * one on a future pinned bump, leaves them all green while nothing reaches the wire.
 *
 * This drives the real @ai-sdk/openai Responses model with a stubbed fetch and reads
 * the request body it actually serialises. No network: the fetch never leaves the
 * process, and the WebSocket transport is not involved because this is the plain
 * provider rather than the OAuth one.
 *
 * The SDK decides on its own whether a model reasons, from an id list
 * (o1|o3|o4-mini|gpt-5*) that matches neither gpt-6 nor the codenamed aliases, and
 * drops the effort for anything it does not recognise. That is what forceReasoning
 * exists to override, and this is the only test that would notice if it stopped
 * working.
